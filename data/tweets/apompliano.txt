fair to say combo of market hurdles moving and generally bad storytelling from pre-seed to seed?
I like revenue from day 1. If you're going to raise though, raise too much early on
not common from what I see and generally think it's bad idea. Sometimes only option tho
point is that better planning and execution would eliminate any bridge. Sometimes external factors, sometimes not
definitely product fail
Ha! I literally said that seconds later - will tag you in tweet. Like that we agree :)
CN is what I've been seeing
seems like  &lt;=50% of their original fundraise. Ex: $500k pre-seed takes another $200k - $250k to bridge gap. Almost all Conv Note
Recently see many companies raising "small notes" to bridge to a true seed round. This means they mismanaged capital or missed projections

impossible to know at earliest stages. those that claim they can predict it are mistaken
disagree. We know exactly what we're looking for. Some people filter by location. We filter founder qualities
potentially miss all exits. We could be completely wrong. Beauty is that time will prove us right or wrong
M. Bennett said "u don't need linebackers that use forks &amp; knives, u want linebackers that eat w/ their hands"
website != legit. That's my point. Every non-legit makes website too. Reputation &amp; word of mouth most powerful
also, we invest in many companies with no websites. Some not even real co yet. Match made in heaven ;)
I know the deals that get funded and I know the ones we see. We see high percentage. Over 1500 in 6 months
if they care, they're not founders we want to invest in. Great filter in that case.
it's not about time, it's about the overall approach to building. our founders don't care &amp; actually love it
also doesn't mean we won't get website in future (we will) but it's just not overly important
the beauty is it doesn't matter what we (investors) think. founders just want help - if you're good, reputation spreads quick
anthony.pompliano@gmail.com
website &amp; branded email don't matter tho. those are just ego strokes for investors. founders find us on twitter &amp; gmail just fine :)

not sure i understand the question. best thing to do is build a business that doesn't require you to raise money.
i do but i don't share it. don't want founders to try to game it. bottom line is there are winners / losers. be a fucking winnerthat's why i don't invest in those teams that I feel shouldn't be running the business :)
that business. anyone can be an entrepreneur but nearly no one is successful trying to do something they're not built to do
it's all about results. either you win or you lose. most times the founder isn't hungry, nor do they understand what it takes to win
there are 1000's of businesses created daily. problem is people trying to build the wrong type of company given their skills
More than 50% of the founders I meet daily should not be running the business. I still haven't found a way to tell them this politely :-/

"That's what happens when you hire real people. They have real lives" -
no i'm talking about high growth companies
i am highly bias to the companies i talk to obviously. definitely emerging trend i'm seeing though
hard to tweet entire thing but most early stage founders thinking differently. they don't want VC dependency over long term
is it fair to say that founder contemplates exit as soon as they think about or successfully raise capital? different dynamics
I think this use to be true but changing. I can think of very few verticals that are truly "winner take most" but may be wrong?
you're assuming founders are building companies with exit as the goal. Founders becoming interested in sustainable cash flow now
elaborate?

the point of business is to make money. companies are starting to focus on this
More companies will stop looking to venture capital as they grow. They'll begin looking for profitability much earlier. Both are good things
love you man!
difference between "this is expectation" vs "you're willing to do whatever it takes to succeed" - hopefully that makes sense
not what I was originally saying. If I can only do call at 4a due to schedule, its warning sign if founder won't get up to talk
yes, but to say "waking up at 4am to talk to investor" is martyrdom is misleading/fear mongering. Remember, investor is up too
ha ! No I wish. That's an amazing find tho
yes, per hour is right. I'm not saying to work every day at 4a tho. I'm saying if not willing then it's signal for other issues
I think there is correlation between capacity for work and outcomes. Narrative &amp;a truth very different based on what I've seen

The most powerful words you can speak to a founder
you're taking the 401 course, i'm still in 201 ;)
I tell every founder the same thing: Make money and you can create unreal social impact. I promise to be their biggest fan
The point of building a company is to make a profit. There are many ways to get there but profitability is always at the end of the rainbow
they didn't caveat w/ that. 25k stores globally. 90M customers/week. Just stats I remember. Knew it was big, was still impressed
So many founders TELL ME about the scalability of their companies but they forget to SHOW ME traction before the scalability point
Today I learned is largest payment processor in the world. Stat came from them. Their app is only ~2 years old. Quite impressive.

different, yes. Still doesn't feel disruptive or transformative tho. VCs always gave advice. Now its rooted in more op experience

Ankesh you're the closest anyone's gotten so far. Stay tuned ;)
very few people make big money. And once you get past the media bullshit, most founders stumble into their success by accident
they can help but not necessary if you're just solely lucky. Human bias makes it hard to separate the cause for success usually
Three of biggest challenges over next 100 years are (1) curing death (2) reducing dependency on sleep (3) eliminating need to eat real food
So many successful people credit "hard work" or "intelligence" for their accomplishments when really "luck" and "accident" are better reason
biggest takeaway so far?
What did you do to improve yourself today?
idea, intuition, check size, follow on decision, etc dont matter. Just make human feel good
only things that correlate to outsize returns 1) in deal 2) early 3) backed right founder
long story short - data shows things that early stage investors care about don't matter
will let you know when ready. Obvious I see this differently, but may be very wrong
you're right today Blake but disagree on keys for tomorrow :)

yes, agreed. I find it easiest to talk with people in tech about tho because it seems outlandish
I'll show you what I've been building and you (Adam) will have great insights. I could be wrong here but dk
I'll show you what I've been working on when I get back. Your job is to shoot holes in it ;)
yes the founder decision will be the hardest part to automate (obviously)
I don't think the challenge is machines making decisions, its finding/creating data sets to feed machines
yes but why do company boards need to be run by humans who are naturally bad decision makers?
first iteration is aiding decision making but I think ultimately the machine will make the decision. Honestly scary...
fair to say human element only important now because of lack of reliable data available?
agree this was true and still mainly true now. Think it won't be majority over next few decades though. Could be wrong
there are VC funds making decisions solely on algorithms already. No human bias/emotion. Computers usually have advantage
efficiency almost always wins out over human desire. Takes a long time but eventually humans evolve preferences
never?! Have to disagree. Machines take thousands of inputs to trade $100Ms+ daily now. Innovation curve accelerating
nearly impossible to say when but I put confidence level at &gt;80% for before 2075. People once thought machines couldn't trade...
I see your point tho and think it's valid. Almost feels like we were "bad" and now we're at "good" but machines out us at "great"
low in comparison based on today's information. I think we'll look back and think it was very high. $0 for human cost can't be beat
yes, because human on other side of transaction for now(ultimately ineffiecent). Machine to machine will win out for cost / outcome
I see. Yes, that is how I think about t at least. Easier to automate service side than relationships tho IMO
elaborate on what categorizes as services based? Specific aspects of a firm or entire firms binary bucket?
my man living up to the Twitter username Nikillinit!
more focused on ruthless honesty but secrets being brought to light would be sub category IMO
was hard to replicate. We understand the brain better than ever. Machines will have emotions. You may even fall in love w/ one

can't wait to talk more about this. Has been consuming most of my time lately as I think through nuances and applications
if there is one thing that I believe more than everyone else, it's "momentum solves your problems." Even named our firm over it
only have read it a minimum of 6 times in my life. Catch up big Jake!
I have the best job in the world. My wish is that each of you gets to experience the magic I feel every day
The more you tell people the hardest, most ambitious thing you're chasing, the more likely people are to rally around you and help.
Uh oh, are media folks catching on to the idea of momentum, whether real or perceived, as the message? üëÄüå™ https://t.co/wqOGSvV2It
agreed. How do you see data being used today? How would you like to see it used in Hollywood?

Ray Dalio
early stage is the most inefficient part of market. Largest severity of info advantage.
honestly I haven't seen tons of writing about the "becoming non-harsh" in delivery of feedback. Horowitz briefly covers it too
accuracy is one of the most important aspects of efficient decision making. If not accurate, then you're merely creating more work
so true. Still internalizing Superforcasters but it was perfect recommendation. Stay tuned!
What We're Reading https://t.co/MdMzmxaBUx https://t.co/RBoPyoadjW
I agree on the unecessarily harsh aspect. It's a developed skill to deliver harsh feedback constructively
As an Italian son who grew up around pizza bosses, I'm not betting against you my friend! https://t.co/SSzKr8HUlU

wait till you see what I'm building internally. Not sure if We're right but it's going to be fun either way!

DM me. I have a few companies you can see where this is already happening
DOES THE PIZZA BIZ SURVIVE?!? Asking for a friend üòâ
totally agree. Wish everyone just accepted it :-/
i see you outworking the competition!
I think late stage VC dies before early stage. More data for machines to crunch. Less inefficient market. Already failing
yes, can't deny that.
I tend to side with Dalio on this more than anyone. Reid is directionally correct but probably not extreme enough IMO. Agree?
agreed. You can speed up the adoption right Kevin?! üòâ
sales. venture capital. Real estate. Most primary care medical professionals. Many SMBs. Just inherently unsustainable
yes, agreed. Problem is if you only have 1 or 2 short interactions with someone, they're unlikely to see larger picture
the shorter list is of relationship driven businesses that will survive. Sadly can't think of a single one. Robots &gt; humans
it's hard to articulate but I generally feel the same
yes, can't take anything away from the velocity/data. Just think it's unsustainable and more likely to be false positive
are you sure it's 100% transparent without any sugar coating? Culturally it's drastically against the norm and creates abrasion
I've always wondered what would happen if I shared my thoughts directly w/ people w/ 100% transparency. Tend to think it would be disaster ü§î
scary to use a single day of data to claim a trend for entire year, no? Also, how many of that 40% will be there in 30 days?
they're so screwed. Just look at what OpenDoor has done, let alone what a removal of human bias/emotion would do
I actually think it will create a more sustainable business model. A robot will soon be able to do 80% of what I do on daily basis
sounds crazy today, but eventually it will just be robots selling to robots.
any vertical that relies on personal relationships to thrive. Dead in the water over next 10-15 years

Relationship driven business models are going to die. The incumbents in those spaces are oblivious which leaves large opportunity

I use "impact" or "impact potential" to describe this but sounds like our definitions are the same

yes. investing isn't a "right" in my mind, it's a privilege. If you don't earn the right, founders should never take $
Secrets out - you're doing it right in front of everyone while screaming in their face about what you're doing. Epic
rather than worry about assessments or perception, I believe in "show rather than say." Too many VCs forget this
if I don't offer significant value &amp; impact in first 30 min call w/ founder, I won't invest b/c they shouldn't take my $
I'm betting our entire firm that model you described is a losing equation moving forward. Impact potential &gt; everything
many fake it but it's not sustainable. results speak volumes
any VC who commits to not firing a founder is lying. No way to know what will happen. VC has fiduciary responsibility
the VCs who try to convince founders that they can create impact almost never do. Founders talk - they know who is real
LPs are mostly sheep. They will overlook many faults if VC has access to best deals.
definition of personal brand is changing though IMO. Impact potential is the new personal brand
shhhh....don't tell the secrets!!
I think this is no longer true. Founders don't want friends, they want someone who creates real impact for their company
so true
I'm literally not smart enough to follow that...
no, impossible to tell return potential at investment. High quality function of founders, market, idea, traction, value, etc
kinda disagree. Founders don't care about either. They're more important than LPs. Access in quality will always bring LPs :)

i've been thinking about knowledge &amp; experience vs "impact" - one influences the other but not always. Impact more important?
fair point &amp; i agree usually. most firms seem to position success of port = track though. websites, talk tracks, branding, etc.
founders are constantly saying "I don't care about the success of your portfolio, I care if you can help me." Important nuance
correct. You're much better at articulating my point concisely :)
that is what incumbents say. It already doesn't resonate in the market as effectively. This trend will accelerate over time

cohort data doesn't lie. too many people don't understand how to analyze or what's healthy numbers
fake retention - focus on vanity metrics - misunderstanding of how to control / impact metrics
Never forget, "You can't act like a big dawg unless you write big dawg checks" 5/
This irrational behavior is seen in expectation of equity stake for the expectation of company traction. Won't last over time 4/
I look at deals much earlier in funding cycle usually. I'm hearing a lot of founders say "I don't want to take their money b/c I heard.." 3/
Founders are the ones who get hurt the most here. They don't get a check and are told misleading feedback on why they investor is passing 2/
So many seed investors act like they're Series A investors lately. Really only hiding a lack of conviction &amp; fear of market uncertainty 1/

I agree thats what majority think. I'm making argument that they're wrong &amp; should prioritize fitness for better performance
can't wait
all pro athletes approach it like pros. why don't all business professionals approach it like professionals? $? time? edu?
also think mental training, focus drills, creative mind expansion, etc will be big. cc
examples? where can i learn more? i think this will become more and more common if already started...
yes, definitely know plenty who prioritize both. Being professional athlete is completely different level of obsession tho
disagree. A professional athlete is different level. I don't know a single biz pro sleeping in chamber, waking up to eat, etc
being an athlete and being a professional one is completely different. I'm talking about sleeping in chambers, massages, etc
Why don't business professionals treat their bodies with as much thought and care as professional athletes?

Mastery of psychology. Both their own &amp; others
1) some founders improve their story telling 2) some founders gain courage to avoid taking bad deals &amp; focus on profitability

Uber, SpaceX, etc too I think - my point is they aren't great at the time. VC's think they can see future, but they can't

Q: What solves a startup founder's problems of fundraising, hiring, acquiring customers, and receiving press?

A: Momentum.
you can hear it, see it, and feel it. The mission driven founders are rare and special
Chris constantly speaks the truth https://t.co/xDaEFbnCIK
"I believe in you"

These are the most powerful words you can say to someone.
Hard to improve something you don't measure
literally ask "why are you working on this instead of anything else in the world?" - authenticity smacks you in the face
mission driven meaning that they're going to be successful with or without help. they're driven by something deep inside themselves
Recently was pitched an investment opportunity in gourmet ice pops. Little kid in me wanted to fund it so bad. Adult in me made me pass
It's easy to identify founders who are mission-driven. The ones who aren't doing it to be cool. Also easy to identify the wannabes.
