What do we want? lol https://t.co/IzMkJk2ajv
6/ Surely the CIA must be schooled in psychological warfare &amp; see what Trump is doing to them. Surely THEY can't fall for his bully tactics
5/ Think: McCain, Rubio, Cruz and even Clinton. But what's most shocking is that he's done this with the CIA. Why don't they call bullshit?
4/ Too often it seems people prefer to be left alone &amp; thus appease Trump vs. antagonize further. Trump uses this playbook again &amp; again
3/ Opponents of Trump then left with choice of allowing the onslaught to continue or be grateful he's now being nice
2/ Then Trump does 180 and compliments you excessively &amp; tries to be your friend
1/ Trump's style seems to be attack you really hard publicly &amp; get masses to turn against you. Leave you reeling
nice one today!

Secondaries have gotten out of hand. If a company's viability still in doubt, $$ should go to lengthen runway &amp; increase value for all

9/ We mustn't ostracize those who go work for Trump. We need the smartest people buffering us from his ego + lack of experience or curiosity
8/ Mostly I loved the sense of camaraderie even through argument. A sense we can't put our heads in the sand. We must work with new gov't

5/ People like me (or tech founders) who can afford to pay taxes will likely pay less as a result of Trump than Clinton. So that's 1 impact
4/ My opinion is that those who most voted for "change" will end up with the opposite results of their intention and ironically ...
3/ Tech journos want tech story. But  REAL story is those who lose healthcare, impact on women's reproductive rights &amp; religious tolerance
2/ In near term I think it has no impact on tech unless it crushes public stock market. That's the only signal I'd watch for now. Black Swan

12/ My standard line to an LP pass was, "Ok. I'll just start early to persuade you next time. Where do I need to improve?"
yes. precisely
11/ Yes, it sucks being told "no." But if you can't handle "no" you'll never be successful as an enterpreneur
10/ For every "pass" a CEO in our portfolio gets I ask them "What could we learn from that 'no'?" This is the essence of sales 101
9/ VCs never share VC hate-mail publicly - it's not worth a public fight. But founders should share this info so they understand the risks
8/ Rarely are VCs dumb enough to send hate mail when other VCs pass but it does happen &amp; it's totally unfair to founders who don't know
7/ The only thing worse than a "revenge email" from a founder to a VC is when your INVESTOR does it without your knowledge
6/ You earn your reputation through many years in the market and world travels far &amp; wide. Even if you're "right" you're wrong
5/ Many, many, MANY LPs passed on Upfront in 2012. I learned from many &amp; enjoyed others. They were biggest supporters in 2015 fund
4/ Some VCs are just assholes. Ok, no value to you. But the cathartic benefit of being nasty back is NEVER worth it
3/ Sometimes you learn from VCs things about your business you hadn't considered. Others they "don't get it" but each case value the future
2/ Your goal should be to learn from each VC experience &amp; build relationships for your future
1/ When you go into fund raising you need to know / expect that the result is that most VCs will say "no" - it's simply the numbers

was was so great. #FourMoreYears
i agree with that, too. i suspect we agree on more than you think. but even i suffer from authenticity gap in hearing her speak
people don't want to hear about it. but she's 100x more aligned on Millennial issues than Trump
like climate, education, immigration reform, women's issues, campaign finance reform? they don't get press but she covers it
sanders for example was authentic and NOT AT ALL charismatic. (also wrong on policy fwiw)
politically i side more with clinton positions than warren. but when warren speaks it connect more. authentic not just charismatic
disagree. warren uses language the feels real, clinton sounds scripted. there's a difference
i think they're protesting to Johnson more than moving to Trump. At least per TV this AM. That's a mistake as large at Brexit
yes. agreed. i met her 1-1 years ago and saw it first hand. but there's a reason for a DEM enthusiasm gap we need to acknowledge
turns out the largely population draws its impressions from media appearance. I agree with you but also know what moves votes
it's not about positions. it's about speaking in a way where you're perceived as "human" like when Clinton cried in NH
I think she is authentic in small crowds (I have seen it) but more wooden on stage. oozes authenticity
I agree re: NYT &amp; WaPo. It's the TV media that can't find the right equilibrium
16/ If you want the longer form, see me over on https://t.co/1FXTpCEJrX
the press needs more backbone on this
it was as though was making it = that a surrogate talked about issue vs. the candidate spewing it constantly
tried this AM but can't help himself. Kept saying "two wrongs don't make a right" What BS
15/ Please speak up. Please vote. It matters #ImWithHer
14/ This is not about elitism vs. the common person. Trump is as elite as they come. This is about who shows up to vote &amp; what we care about
13/ Some British friends cited Brexit as a protest vote. Protest votes have consequences. Protest for your positions on Nov 9th
12/ Many British friends were stunned by Brexit. It seemed unreal until it happened. We cannot suffer an enthusiasm gap at the polls
11/ As a father I care about the world my sons grow up in. I care that they learn about tolerance &amp; acceptance &amp; opportunities for all
10/ As a citizen I care about equality of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation. I care about science &amp; technology &amp; climate change
9/ Some people think VCs shouldn’t speak about politics. I am a citizen. I care about the health &amp; soul of our country
8/ Trump clearly beats Clinton on authenticity. It’s just that Trump’s authenticity is self-interest, narcissism &amp; winning at any cost
7/ Media hits Clinton on transparency. I agree. But Trump is the least transparent candidate in modern history
6/ I know people are tired of hearing about politics. We must not tire before Nov 9th. We must finish the race strong
5/ We cannot accept the normalization and desensitization of racist positions or conspiracy theories. Trump peddels these
4/ Trump called for a ban on Muslims coming to America. This is un-American
3/ Trump himself called Mexican immigrants murderers &amp; rapists. We cannot let media forget this. WE cannot forget this
2/ Trump team tried to pin birtherism on Clinton who has never uttered the vile remarks that Trump has. We will not be duped
1/ I watched Trump surrogates this AM try to downplay his 5 years of his race-baiting birtherism. We are not stupid. We know what he did

agreed. which is nuts. that's my point
nope. don't know. we can look into it. thanks.
where did i say that?

haven't we heard the hatred enough already, andrew? how much more free press does he deserve without any real policies?

I don't support vile from anybody
it doesn't bother me personally. but when someone I don't know does it they're likely abusive with others. just highlighting
and I'm not easily intimidated so it's not about ME. It's about others or about those who receive much worse bullying
If somebody publicly calls you faggot or fucking idiot (as I was today) it's not enough to say "you can stop using Twitter"
free speech != abusive online bullying and especially in a network privately owned that can choose its own rules
I normally do. But to those who don't face abuse I wanted to show what it feels like and Loren is a known troll https://t.co/FpwDdTyttl
