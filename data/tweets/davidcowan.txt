15 yrs ago "religious freedom" was used to justify banning interracial marriage-now it's used to ban gay marriage. Not relevant?
I don't think so. Once someone writes the software to simulate "liveness" for any biometric, it's done for everyone.
Religious freedom was also the basis for banning interracial marriages. "God created people differently for a reason" http://t.co/OpllwLBbQx
Great point. Liveness makes it much more difficult to spoof biometrics (e.g. "Say this phrase..."). But not impossible.
