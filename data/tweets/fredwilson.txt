yessssss. That's how Twitter should do it
algorithmic timelines have downsides though. As FB has found out. I think Twitter doesn't do enough algo and FB does too much
yessssss. That is what I'm talking about!!!!
for example I would like to mute for a day or a week or a month. I always worry once I mute someone it's forever
mute and unfollow are two of Twitter's most underrated and under used features. They should make them easier to use
I am more interested in how to solve the problem than product management  philosophy or critiques of Twitter
if you were a Twitter product manager would you build a recommended unfollow list for users?
this is tagged "beach punk" https://t.co/KowhkdwIFD
an nobody sitting near him. except that kid.
unfollow and/or mute. Your timeline represents the choices you have made. Change them.
that might be a reflection of what you are tweeting. I avoid tweeting about politics and that helps a lot.
try unfollowing or muting the people who are filling your feed with noise. It's amazing what it feels like to be rid of them
I would have preferred a blowout in the first half.
there is a unfollow feature. It's not Twitter's fault if you are following the wrong people
are you watching Jets Pats?
i saw this ad during the Giants Browns game and loved the Etsy cameo https://t.co/BnxvKQ7uKi
the vast majority of SoundCloud users listen to those 100 million tracks. That's why they use SoundCloud.
I don't really use FB. Never warned up to it. That's R2 a third party Creston app I use to control devices in my home
I don't folder anything ever. I am a dedicated disorganiser. I prefer chaos and mess.
it's the architecture of the internet. It's not a one way broadcast system. It's a two way interactive system
SoundCloud has 100 million tracks that Spotify doesn't have. Services with an upload button are fundamentally different
I agree. I have the Uber app on my phone but only use it where Juno is not available. I also love the classic yellow taxi cab.
ridesharing apps are like mobile OSes. Commodity at this point. Hardly any difference between them

with Trump representing past and the opportunity for someone new to emerge to represent the future.

try it out. It's way better than having your head in your phone during the game
like me. JETS JETS JETS
it's an oldy but goody. Was state of the art eight years ago
If $twtr keeps doing this live sports thing, I think you will see user growth.

heads up: there is more than one way to do things. I like my way just fine
long train rides
12/ fin
11/ Twitter is that person who is hard to get to know but once you get past their hard exterior turn out to be the best friend you ever had
10/ that would be great. And I am sure they are trying to. But I sure hope they don't lose the power by making it simpler
9/ maybe they can figure out how to make all of this power easier to access for new users or casual users
8/ but regardless of whether there is something else that works like this, I think it's an example of why Twitter is so damn awesome
7/ I am not aware of any other conversational tool out there that works this way
6/ and others can join in by replying to them
5/ what is cool is that these semi private convos are shown to the people that follow all of us in the thread
4/ these conversations aren't private between just the 3 or 4 or 5 of us but they also don't go out to the 550 thousand (ish) followers
3/ my absolute favorite way to use Twitter is to have semi private conversations with a few others by staring tweets with their usernames
2/ But for me Twitter's power is that you can use it so many different ways. From that wonky syntax comes great power
1/ I know Twitter is too hard to use. Too wonky. Why do you have to put a . before the sign if you want everyone to see your tweet?

4/ Jack Nicklaus was assigned the reply and he wrote to the young man "turn pro"
3/ a young man wrote "I hit my one iron 250 yards with a ten yard fade. What do I do?"
2/ there was a section called "ask the pro"

it would be great if VCs didn't mandate anything of their portfolio companies
great feedback. have you shared the specific issues with ?
hell no. that would be really bad form
i would not. i am in favor for my more rights for angels, not less
VCs, company counsels, and even entrepreneurs treat angels as second class citizens even though they are the first to say yes
sadly it is not. notes and new fangled capital raising scenarios are making it worse not better
they did have a solution for this. they may still have it in market.
that should be my goal with all of them!
getting to true product market fit is the big problem. most don't get there
i will do that going forward. such a great suggstion
yeah, i loved that. "blockchain it"  so gooooood
collectively, yes they do. imagine an entire company making this an issue at an all hands
i don't believe that is true. it is in our interests to have an accurate cap table
the shares and options are issued via the service, electronically. no more paper certs. ecerts!!
most from mobile, but i am on a plane and i tend to use a laptop on a plane for some reason

11/ finished
10/ if you have a startup, invest in startups or work at startups, check out https://t.co/tExXUU8hk7 to see what cap tables should be like
9/ we think eShares and services like it are the answer and we have put our money where our mouth is
8/ it is time for all investors (angels and VCs), companies, company counsels, and most of all, employees, to demand a new and better way
7/ i have been dealing with this nonsense since i got into the VC business in the mid 80s and nothing has really changed
6/ i am so sick and tired of all the shortcomings of the current system of paper certs, badly constructed spreadsheets, and lots of errors

I'm moving on. Can't waste any more time on this.
I didn't say that about the apple watch I said that about the entire wearables market More putting words in my mouth
yes but as I said in one of my two year end posts I think this market is really about our personal mesh
I'm very bullish on blockchain and bitcoin from a technical perspective although I don't really care about the price of bitcoin
same thing
it's already happening
more like #ranter  two cups of latte was a bad move ;)
as is the practice of putting words in my mouth time and time again. I've had enough of it. It's crap
you would think that the words we write would be good enough for them and that they would not need to produce new ones
why do you guys feel the need to put words in my mouth?????? i never said "flop"  it so fucking annoying
i am so pissed off.
woke up to this "You're on the scroll on CNBC. Quoting you that "the Apple Watch will be a flop" A bit of creative editing"
no fucking way. i wouldn't reward you for the gross mischaracterization with my presence on your god awful media outlet
read the post again please. i was talking about the entire wearables market which is way bigger than the apple watch
as i am to be confused with brad!
6/ finished
5/ I don't think the watch form factor will define wearables in the same way that the smartphone defines the mobile market
4/ I think wearables will involve many devices, some of which we will wear and some of which we won't
3/ I don't think everyone wants a computer on their wrist. But plenty will and I am certain that apple will sell a lot of them
2/ here is the exact quote "The Apple Watch will not be the homerun product that iPod, iPhone, and iPad have been." http://t.co/fvE16byYr8
