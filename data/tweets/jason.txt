Whoa... https://t.co/TPElZ0tHcN

can you think of a better one in industry?
don't know enough, can someone just show up with a product and get access to 10,000 angel investors?
who does it better?
you can easily find the imperfect stats, as companies are self-reporting them and spending massively to improve them.
can you think of an industry that is more open or a meritocracy? Perhaps sports or poker/chess?
wait, makes a pass-through dongle for the #iPhone?!

Name any startup or startup idea you think needs funding &amp; I will teach you how to bootstrap it (build it without funding).
name a startup, I can tell you how to bootstrap it
people are jumping into the middle of the thread; to be clear, we are talking about the lowering the traction bar
sure
yep, that's you're experience. I've seen folks skip F&amp;F and build something modest, land one investors &amp; repeat
also, given the tools out there you can build an MVP on WordPress, typeform &amp; Zapier etc with duck tape / low skills
nontechnical folks can find a technical cofounder or learn to code; i.e. I found for weblogs Inc
bar we are talking about is traction; so, saying 'I'm going to meet even though revenue/traffic is low'
always up for coffee!
To be clear to folks jumping into our discussion about the 'funding bar' -- we are talking about when traction gets… https://t.co/Z1haGkl8tR
*cash
if you give me any startup idea, I can give you a plan to iterate your way there with little or no cadh
not assuming that, I'm more in the camp of iterating you're way in, by developing sought after skills &amp; making MVPs
to be clear, we were talking about the standard needed to get funded in Silicon Valley -- and lowering that
read the entire thread; we were talking about the bar for traction to get a startup funded--people are taking it out of context
i do understand that one tweet out of context looks odd.
if you read the whole thread, we are talking specifically about the bar for traction to get investment.
uhhh... think we are in agreement here. If you don't have enough candidates, just look back to the earlier funnel.
yes, that's true. Many investors might give standford students money with less traction than Fordham ones.
incorrect, we are saying lowering the bar specifically around traction. Read entire thread.
if unrepresentatived, that by definition means there are less; if you want to find more, you need to find them earlier.
correct... or less traction might be best way to say it.
so 'lower the bar in terms of traction' is the point here
you have to seek out less developed startups, folks who are being ignored / haven't achieved traction
no parade, will take a cookie 🍪 // if you set the bar at 'funded' or 'covered in tech press' you will not have diversity
I'm talking in the context of investing only -- if you have results, folks will invest
so, when underrepresented founders email me -- even with less/modest progress -- I spend more time with them to give advice
if you select founders on the top 25 trending on angellist/CrunchBase or techcrunch you won't find a diverse group
continue...
that's why my team works hard to provide 10k free tickets to https://t.co/Ql0jknkSGv &amp; we seek out female/URM founders 💪❤
point is, if you pick the top 25 trending startups on TechCrunch/angellist/etc to meet as an investor, it won't be diverse.
Interesting read, we should probably retire 'open kimono' &amp; 'off the reservation' -- especially in business. https://t.co/EzV4dss41y
hard work and results can trump any bias -- I believe that.
they wouldn't let me apply to those schools 😂😂😂
you have to work to find URM/female founders on those lists; I know because we do that!
if you do 10 meetings &amp; choose 10 trending startups on Angellist what will happen?
I couldn't get into a good school, wasn't a good student -- had to fight my way in... 😂😂😂
I think it's the most effective technique for all investors... find and mentor folks
if I meet with more URM/female founders, I can give them advice earlier on how to grow 💪❤
sounds like affirmative action, but it's true: I meet with female/URM founders earlier
or you can produce 100 episodes of with a team of 4 -- for free -- to educate everyone 💪❤️
I can see the revenue clearly when I talk to the founder and tap my vast experience 😂
what is subjective about revenue and earnings? Just focus on that &amp; you'll be just fine.
these questions will determine if/from who you're fundable; remember VC's don't invest in businesses that can't go 100X+
1. What are last six months revenue &amp; % growth? 2. What business model? 3. URL?
it's going to magically drop from the sky... haven't you seen the buckets of 💰 all over the streets?!😂
all business are ultimately valued on revenue &amp; earning. See apple &amp; Microsoft.
a founder can pick a faux metric &amp; convince a dopey investor it's traction, yes. Real investors know.
almost in the right order, it's 1. Traction, 2. Traction, 3. Traction, 4. Product, 5. Everything else
we also produce 100 episodes of https://t.co/LmqqvgkbW3 a year that helps outsiders understand how it all works.
we focus on solving problem w/ https://t.co/Ql0jknkSGv being 100% free &amp; open to all founders:10k free tickets!
explain what preference you see... is it product, traction, education, gender or race? Rank those.
serious question: do you believe that Silicon Valley supports 2-3 minority groups while working to stop 2-3 others?
don't give Silicon Valley any credit for its unmatched support of outsiders. Breaks virtue signaling!
however, give me any product &amp; I will teach you hown I make boot strap it... I do this all day long.
if you want to make an electric car or plane, or a new drug, very hard to bootstrap.
if you know how to code, you can make an MVP in social or enterprise with 1-2 people... then get funded based on that
term our industry uses is URM: under represented minorities. Indian &amp; Asians are well represented, yes.
everyone wants to get credit for believing in bias... bias is a fact, so let's move on &amp; talk about solutions.
everyone agrees bias exists, let's not pretend anyone disagrees with a fact. That's culture war / virtue signaling bs
Solid, solid guests https://t.co/dBllqkuQ6C

given the number of investors, even if 50% were biased (doubtful), if you have performance you have thousands to tap.
if you have performance in startups--what we are talking about--it always trumps bias. 💯 because, revenue! Profits!

#realtalk
17/that's it. I'm done. If you've been faking as a founder you have permission to fold up shop on Monday. If you're legit, let's crush 2017.
16/so many fakers who can only sign the front of checks -- we need killers who can sign the back of checks. Revenue! Profits! Growth! 💪💰💰💰💰
15/fakers: go back to your mom's basement, eat you hot pockets, get your graduate degree in dipshit studies &amp; let the Jedi do Jedi work.
14/too many fakers our their getting drunk at Summit at Sea &amp; TEDx dumbville, thinking they can build important stuff -- with no skills.
13/being the founder means you're responsible for everything. If someone doesn't show up for work or you can't find talent YOU HAVE TO DO IT
12/this is for your own good, not mine. If you have no skills &amp; decide one day 'f&amp;$k it, I'll start a company... ' get your head examined.
11/if you can't code, can't sell, can't design, can't lead, can't hire and/or can't inspire, for $&amp;@? sake do not take the founder role.
10/it's like the year after the Blairwitch project in Silicon Valley, a legion of dopes running around pretending to make important films.
9/I'm absolutely disgusted &amp; embarrassed by the level of effort I'm seeing out there from many of you. You need to level up your skills!
8/if you need to hire recruiters, PR people &amp; sales people to get shit done in year 0 you're too soft. Pick up the phone &amp; sell/hire/pitch!
7/if you can't make a solid MVP with zero dollars, sweat equity or your own resources you're hopefully behind &amp; Woefully unqualified!
6/easiest way to make money? Learn esoteric, in demand coding skill or be a relentless sales executive: $500-1m a year comp, no risk!
5/if you think this is easy please go read some books... startups are the hardest way to make money! It's 80-90% chance of failure!
4/how can you complain that you can't convince talented people  to work for you and then expect people to invest money in you?!?
3/why on earth do you think it's wise to have no business model or the ability to name any of the 20 startups that tried your idea &amp; failed?
2/how the you expect anyone to invest in your company if you're not willing to start building until you get investment?

6/@facebook will piss off the right by ranking journalists because it will show that there simply aren't as many conservative reporters.
5/ranking the best journalists, statistically, will not result in a 50-50 balance of liberal &amp; conservative voices due to the pool.
4/adding to the complexity, journalists here in USA are largely intellectuals from cities &amp; doesn't want to anger the right
3/the real issue here is that the right wing sites are primarily opinion based &amp; left sites are equally reporting &amp; opinion.

5/Big question of where this film would fall in among 7. It's better than 1, 2, 6 (not hard), as good as 3, 4 &amp; 7; nothing touches 5 TESB!
4/There are many powerful moments where the fans SCREAMED &amp; CLAPPED during the film. People were crying, laughing and cheering last night.
3/the film does massive service to the cannon, filling up plot holes with major "ahhh.... now I understand!" 40. years. later. Wow.
2/I won't give away anything that's not in the trailer, but I will talk about the film a bit; this ensemble isn't Jedi &amp; Princess based.
1/So much to love about #RogueOne; it's gritty, doesn't follow all of the Star Wars traditions &amp; has a unique, almost Blade Runner style

'A more civil on twitter' -- I think that's a episode no? 😂 https://t.co/icKDV6HmUV
I think that's the first feature can work on 'mute thread!' 😂😂😂 seriously, good luck Keith, rooting for you! 💪❤️
The new head of product took 7 or 8 years off the platform 🤔 'no pressure' or 'fresh eyes?' 😂 https://t.co/eZR9p8aHah
 I think that's a fine 15 minute segment
Interesting debate: should twitter product be run by someone with 146 tweets? 🤔 https://t.co/oojyg8RQye
Unless they give you $20m, don't do it 😂😂💰💰💰👑 https://t.co/XDKEePsBWM
 which ones?
Have had many offers to move up a stack &amp; be VC writing less, but bigger checks; it's appealing. Stay tuned. https://t.co/shupz2tNkQ
get to work; press comes after success
yes
4/I think this is a very smart move for VCs; why bother with 75 angel investments to find the 10 winners? Waste of time if you have $300m+
3/If a VC does back a founder w/ a deck it's probably a serial entrepreneur; VCs moved up the stack, gave early stage to angels/incubators
the list is at 6 🙏🏼❤️️
💪❤️
invest in 20 startups, have a two hits &amp; you qualify! 😂
serial founders with exists?
 angel investors like to pick which startups to work with; that's the 'video game/poker' of angellist
I haven't explicitly offered my syndicate to join my Fund;if/when we do I doubt any/many will
I have a Fund &amp; 2nd largest syndicate ever (@gilpenchina is #1) &amp; #1 most active; no AL to LP *yet*
Great episode... https://t.co/WDB4WllAd7
like I said, about 5 VCs left making unknown bets 😂
did you found all three of those? 😂😂😂💰💰💰
incorrect; angels don't have chip stack to do a $4-10m round
you are one of about 5 VC's with courage to do pre-product market for these days. -- very few.
I'm betting will evolve into a cable subscription
odd cc
2/if you're a VC in 2016 with a huge fund, there is no reason to suffer through product/market fit or early traction

trump: "rip the baby from the womb of the mother" at nine months #debatenight "on the final the day" -- brutal debate.
Hillary's performance is her best to date. She is confident and while boring, at least you know her position.  #debatenight
Now moderator holding clinton to her position... doing a fantastic job making candidates state their position clearly. #debatenight
Trump supports a woman's right to choose... moderator holding him to the fire with his non answer was well done.  #debatenight
best moderator so far... wonder how long this one will last... 20 minutes?  #debatenight
I will, once again, give my candid feedback on the dumpster fire... i mean, debate... tonight.  #debatenight

Amazing answer from trump! She's a fighter and she doesn't give up. Wow. What just happened!?!?!?! They should have asked that first!
I'm bracing for what trump is going to say he likes about hillary...
Great last question... amazing answer from Hillary to praise the kids -- who looked dumbfounded.
Trump going strong in support of You might not like it... but he does!
Trump relentlessly calling out moderators is deft... he keeps jabbing the moderators on time, which takes the focus off his interrupting.
So trump's plan is a sneak attack... I agree, that always works!!! 😂😂😂🙊🙈🙉
SNEAK ATTACK! Love it.... America F-YEAH! That will solve the problem... how is trump still in this??!
Trump really gets an edge when he hammers her on the emails &amp; "why didn't you do it?!" Thread. Hillary wins when she is less scripted.
Trump is doing better in debate two--his energy is growing during the debate. I think because he's more comfortable when it gets aggressive.
Love how Trump keeps bringing up -- such an amazing troll. It's elite level trolling.
This ISIS/Muslim Ban line of question is awesome... people care about this -- around the world. Trump's "safe zones".... hmmm...
Trump's energy his a high with the email assault... he peaked at 45 minutes last time, then collapsed. Will he collapse at 40 minutes again?
I don't know who is winning this debate, but I can tell you who is losing -- Americans.
"Three on one..." was a great line by trump -- confirms media bias belief his base has. Hillary looks great letting him run wild.
Trump going "full trump" is his most effective strategy... so raw &amp; it makes her default back to being on script. Probably won't work..
Wow... promising a special prosecutor threat. "Because you would be in jail.... " one liner of the night. This is getting brutal...
Hillary gets applause for "going high" and never addresses Bill Clinton's impeachment -- savvy to continue to deflect.
Here we go... Trump goes for the knock out with Bill Clinton. Audience applause for the first time... people hate the Clintons.
"It's just words folks..." is a pathetic response. Trump should apologize clearly to everyone involved, his wife, his kids and his staff.
Hillary is crushing him. This is the most candid and real we've seen Hillary this whole campaign -- this is how she truly feels.
Hillary looks angry.... she looks like she wants to punch him.
Wow -- goes for the knockout punch immediately! Trump's best response is to deflect to #isis?! Bizarre response.
Why is trump breathing into the microphone so deeply... strange he doesn't know how to use a microphone.
Softball question to start things out!?!? How come we didn't start with the Clinton WikiLeaks or the Trump Access Hollywood Tapes?
No handshake. That was negotiated before the start I'm guessing? #debates
Prediction: Trump Apologies, then points to Clinton's accusers/victims &amp; then points to the former President. Thing explode
