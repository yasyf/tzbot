holy shit...wow
same, that's why it makes me so mad that Twitter hasn't just baked this in. 😭
- Keyword mute (good call Also...remove ads, because their ads are terribly irrelevant.
- Better user discovery and suggestions
- Lists (think this is a huge missed opportunity for Twitter)
Twitter features I'd pay for:
- More "While You Were Away"
- Smarter push notifications (i.e. Nuzzel)
- A built-in
Twitter Pro, I'd pay $5/month for features like this.
so awesome to see is an esports fan.
definitely agree, feed curation is key too. Often times, I'll jump into someone's tweet, read their replies and join in on convo.
by not following a ton of people, I make it a priority to meaningfully engage with the people I do follow.
I agree that grades SHOULD be irrelevant, but they weren't in my case... 😔
exactly
- sure, but that's insanely hard to judge now. When I approached JT, I interned at Nest, SpaceX, etc
if I didn't have strong grades in college, I feel pretty confident I wouldn't have had "big" internships
unfortunately, grades are VERY relevant if you don't go to a top tier school.
this is awesome. Thank you...

Is "3rd place" the new blue flame? 🔥
-- overall, I 100% agree, but I think Discord and subreddits are where these communities live.
games are definitely the infrastructure here, but I view Discord, subreddits, twitter, etc. as destinations.
100%, just wish it was worded differently.
yeah that's definitely fair. I wouldn't underestimate the gaming community though. Wish they explored other monetization routes
Personally, I'm a *bit* skeptical that people will feel the need to "support" Discord when they have raised &gt;$30M.

a proprietary deal doesn't need to be T1, IMO. It's that you're seeing deals that not everyone else is.

as it stands Twitters discourages users from following more users.

was that intentional? 👀 Medium?
A small part of me wonders what Twitter could do with something like under their belt.
yeah, I just think users should be rewarded for responsiveness and engagement too.
https://t.co/2cL67Cto8m -- let's you just tweet out a link with more than 140 characters. I.e. https://t.co/0RQrAj4qkE
After a certain amount of time, you give up hope. You stop tweeting and eventually stop following these people.
Imagine being a kid that follows big influencers or YouTube. They reply to every tweet from these influencers and never get a response back.
Another example is that the tech community has extremely responsive influencers, but other verticals might not.
For example, the esports community actively uses TwitLonger for announcements, stories, etc. rather than tweetstorms or Medium.
One of the biggest challenges that Twitter faces is that each community uses it sooo differently.
or would it be determined via number of reports/user discretion?
interesting, wish this existed. the threshold for determining a troll would be hard to programatically determine, no?
do you both have an Echo/Home? I, also, still find myself using Sonos for music vs. Echo.

yeah, most people I know literally use it as a glorified Sonos/alarm clock. The potential is there though.

that's a legendary pro-tip. +1 for hard shell making a comeback.
100% agree, but a lot of fund managers (IMO) focus more on optics than realized returns -- unfortunately.
i.e. I'm sure there were VCs that raised additional funds by boasting they were early investors in Fab, etc.
realized or not, unfortunately the VC wins, and the LPs don't see their returns for quite some time.
meant it more like the fund managers were able to raise much larger funds because of having these "unicorns."
(they were able to raise subsequent funds by saying they were early investors in these companies)
sure, but regardless of realized returns here, early investors in those companies did exceptionally well.
congrats! So well deserved!
likewise! Your a hustler. Everyone in VC has a story, glad you've encouraged so many to share theirs. 👌

enjoy! Happy New Year!
it was a thought experiment, don't take it too serious. 😂
I'm asking Paul, because he has taken bets on teams and given them ideas (i.e. Reddit)...
I think it would work well, especially with seasoned founders.
any thoughts on YC taking applications from individuals? And YC helping to match teams + ideas.

yeah, there's a lot to unpack here.
Maybe: Team In Residence, instead of EIR?
absolutely, don't know if it works at scale. But I think having a group of EIRs is better.
either or!
yup, but definitely leave more autonomy up to the founders.
.@rjonesy not sure if Reddit counts, but rejected their initial application and asked them to work on what would later become Reddit.
Been thinking about this a lot lately, and would love to see an accelerator take individual applicants and group them together on a team.

yeah, big fan of social accountability too
big fan of fiction and business books

ah, that's smart. Hours would make more sense.
Truthfully, just putting these out here so I feel more accountable to do these things! Excited for the new year!

Work Out More:
- Goal is to go to the gym at least twice a week. Starting small here, but want to get in the habit.
Wake Up Earlier:
- Goal is to get up before 7:30AM EST every week day.
Write More:
- My hope is to write at least one post a week, but not going to force myself to write about anything. Quality &gt; Quantity, IMO
Read More:
- Goal is to read at least one book every two weeks. Any recommendations welcomed! :)
2017 Goals:
- Read More
- Write More
- Wake Up Earlier
- Work Out More

yup, same here. Struggling to think of use-cases for AirPods, yet everyone loves them.
bearish as in pessimistic 🐻
the units are definitely out there, just a matter of providing enough utility to consumers -- IMO.
do you feel the same way about Home/Echo? I tend to agree
I think voice would need its own unique value prop, rather than trying use the existing app ecosystem.
definitely agree
the utility gained by voice assistants is minimal (IMO). It feels a lot easier to just use my phone, computer, etc.
FWIW, I am very bear-ish on voice assistants (at least for 2017)
Why don't you use Siri regularly?
Siri has to be one of the worst voice assistants on the market.

😂I knew what he meant, but it made me second think the phrase "pro bowler"
Context: Someone sent me a deck, and one of their advisors was a NFL player. Instead of listing the team/position, it said "4x Pro Bowler."
Everyone who said: "played in pro bowl" is lying. I'm convinced.

With the help of YouTube and Twitch, it's not far-fetched to make a *healthy* career out of gaming.
When I was high school, l'd watch MLG tournaments nightly. Becoming a pro gamer was the dream, but it didn't feel like a "real" career.
If I was a kid, I'd almost guarantee that my dream job would be to become a YouTuber or Twitch streamer.
😉
Q: Is "live" the only way that video (with sound) works at scale? 

&gt;90% of the social/messaging content I consume is on mute.
also, my gut tells me that most people watch or consume content on FB/IG without sound.
.@sarthakgh 100%, the question becomes -- in my mind: "Are Messenger and IG good enough to deter new users from downloading/trying SC?"
? :)
On a more serious note, FB is clearly scared. Tweaking almost all of their core products to combat Snapchat.

hey! no great reason honestly, been a busy past couple of days. I'll be around again soon :)
Twitch is very reactive with their product updates. They're sleeping at the wheel, and it's going to bite them.
mainly battery consumption AND/OR self-control from randomly scrolling through FB.
interesting! didn't even think about that
For some reason or another, a lot of my friends opt to use FB on mobile web vs app.

I'm confused. I'm not allowed to feel like the odds were stacked against me? It's how I felt and I worked hard as hell to get here.
whaaaa? How?
sure, but I'm just saying how I felt. I can only imagine how it feels for others. It's a big reason why I try to be approachable.
I definitely do it more stealthily now (sourcing/reaching out to founders), but I've sourced multiple deals via twitter.
I definitely still do it, but not nearly as much.
of course, but...cmon...you knew what I meant. Breaking into startups, VC, and tech in general felt impossible while in college.
There is obviously more to the story here, but Twitter opened doors that I never would have discovered without this platform.

it also gave me a lot of perspective on Google, tech companies, and SMB's.
proud of this for a ton of reasons, but my role at Google helped me mature a lot. And taught me a ton of invaluable lessons.
Hardest decision in recent years was deciding not to renege on my Google acceptance for Ludlow out of college.
ha, fine. I'll answer here. Not a fan of people having to pay to unlock my free answer. 😔
Pshh, your question was too open ended for me to give a concrete answer.
thus, the big pubs don't want to pay each other 30%.
nope, both are free. It's just that Steam, uPlay, https://t.co/ZgqGqiYnjG, etc. take 30% like the App Store.
the consumer doesn't care *that* much because they just have to load a separate launcher. All still work on PC.
for example Blizzard/Activison only uses https://t.co/ZgqGqiYnjG, and Ubisoft uses uPlay
yes, tons of exclusives. It's already started where big game pubs only use their distribution platforms.
not only that Oculus has their own competitor to SteamVR (Oculus Home). :)
yeah, hiring might go down as one of their better strategic moves.
https://t.co/ExLriBpcwp
They've worked on it a bit for gaming. Specifically, they launched a partnership with Blizzard to do one-click livestreaming.
It's a great q, my gut tells me that FB Live's success steered them to this direction. (assuming they've been watching Twitch)
Thanks Faisal! Means a ton, hope all is well :)

Thanks Will! Hope all is well bud! :)
Yeah, Amazon bought Curse (and Curse Voice) earlier this year though, which is one of the biggest competitor/threats to Discord.
thanks Mark! Hope all is well!
.@Besvinick Yes! They either get bought or they go head-on with Steam, FB, https://t.co/ZgqGqjfYIg, by launching their own app store.
That being said...I also think is in one the best positions to own the distribution and app store.
For context, Steam, https://t.co/ZgqGqjfYIg, etc. are all the app stores for gaming. If FB can pull this off...it will generate billions.
Facebook is one of the few major technology companies that understands the massive opportunity that lies ahead for gaming and esports.
Within the next 12 months, I'd expect them to make a move into the VoIP space as well. Wouldn't be shocked to see them acquire
Facebook officially announced Gamesroom. Their competitor to Steam, https://t.co/ZgqGqjfYIg, etc.

I think Amazon is a sleeper acquirer of Twitter. They could do a lot on the media side via Twitter.
Yeah it would be fascinating!
the whole purpose of this, IMO, would be to get really talented people to work together on new things.
Ever been to a hackathon or Startup Weekend, my guess is it'd work similarly to that -- where certain individuals champion ideas.
ha, I don't know. This was a 6PM Sunday thought. My initial thought was having an interview/application process.
why can't they still solve real pain points organically? Brainstorm with other individuals about problems they seek to solve?
sure, but I'd guess that these individuals would likely work on other projects down the road -- this could be where they first met.
My gut tells me some incredible products and founding teams will be formed.
Accelerator idea: Pick 100 amazing individuals and pay them for 3months. Encourage them to work on whatever and with whomever in the batch.

if FLOMs, Wu-Tang Highs, Paris SBs, etc. all go for &gt;$8k, I'm shocked these didn't go for more.

yup, which makes it even easier for these channels to be fads.
ehhhh, tons of YT accounts with &gt;1M subscribers that struggle to break 50k views on videos now. Kids sub to hundreds of people.
definitely fair (Rain &amp; Apex dropped out with &lt;500k subs), but...most people dropping out for startups have raised some sort of $.
these 3 are, but definitely others that aren't gamers. A lot of "vine-stars" have switched to YT, as it's proven out monetization.
Examples:
@Faze_Rain (4.1M) - https://t.co/Hc4vpkOHNc

I'm rooting for it and hope it works, because there are some amazing implications if it works.
Snapchat played a pivotal role in making selfies "cool." Can they make camera glasses "cool" too? I'm pretty pessimistic.
x1000, very important test for them.
absolutely agree, but I think many will be against the idea of having glasses with cameras. Even though it's inevitable.
ha, fair enough. I just think "normals" are going to be very confused and troubled by these.

Yup, rumors are circulating that Twitter is potentially getting acquired. Unclear who the bidder is though.
Acquiring Twitter would be a great step towards organizing the live components.
Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.

have you held a 6 lately? It feels like an ant relative to the plus. I carry my phone in my hand most of the time.
😮 whaaa?
If you answer emails and spend most of your day on the phone - wouldn't you want more screen space, better battery, and camera?
I'm 2 for 2, on convincing people to try out the 6+ and they love it.
love my 6+, getting a 7+ for sure. Honestly, this phone feels tiny now. Highly recommend trying it -- you'll never look back!
yeah, I've completely forgot what it's like to be able to use a phone with one-hand. No regrets though. Love the Plus
You'll never turn back. I got a 6 Plus, and it's the best phone I've ever had. Going for a 7 Plus (128gb, matte black)

Look at the commentary every time Google's self-driving car has an accident or Tesla autopilot. Very similar levels of empathy.
When a rocket explodes, you are destroying so many valuable assets on-board. Years of research, time, and work. i.e. FB's Satellite
Meh, I think we emphasize every hard-tech. i.e. "Self-driving cars are hard." A rocket is carrying years of other peoples work too.
When did I ever imply those weren't hard? When SpaceX "fails" the entire US space industry fails. Not going to feed the trolls...

[new post] “Shortening Feedback Loops” -- my solution to the long feedback loops that you experience in VC. https://t.co/PeO8JzmDy6
excited to read it!
as it is to me! 😬 meant more towards VCs that cancel last minute or show up 15-20 minutes late for no "real" reason
+1, everyones time in theory should be equal, but...fundraising is a distraction for most founders.
of course! That's the hope and goal.
It's meant more towards someone who strings a founder along for weeks at a time. That founder could have better used their time.
It's a controversial tweet, but fundraising is a distraction for most. At the end of the day, they just want to work on their co.
An entrepreneur's time is far more valuable than a VC's time. Not sure why certain VC's feel entitled to think otherwise.

certain teams act more like media companies than teams, IMO. See: &amp; -- merch, YT, Twitch, and sponsors

really really strong team that successfully tackled one of the hardest challenges while being bootstrapped.
Ha, yeah, no regrets at all. Love my job and wouldn't change it for the world, just fun to reflect. :)
haha, of course! I love my job more than anything - wouldn't have changed anything. Fun to just reflect. :)
he was asking me to apply/interview for a job essentially.

Completely agree, Instagram easily hurt Vine, because influencers are such a key component of Vine.
yeah, when you searched Twitter on the day that Instagram Stories came out - the sentiment was: "first Vine, now Snapchat."
https://t.co/CiNB7eYrMk
Nope, I have both and rarely watch them. Aside from binge watching a new series. YT is my go-to for watching great content.
Casey Neistat is obviously unreal too.
ah, man. I watch a ton of different YouTubers. I grew up watching everyone in OpTic and FaZe (gamers that also vlog)
Aside from the Olympics, I can't remember the last time I watched TV. YouTube is where I consume almost all of my video content.

I'm super bull-ish about VR, but I couldn't be more bear-ish about watching games in VR. I think we are terrible directors haha
I heard #brands only offer the free items to "verified" influencers.
it's nuts.
yup, see the next tweet. Only had room for 140characters
The same owners of a team, also owned the biggest match betting site in Counter-Strike. How much shadier can this industry get?
Another day...another scandal in esports. Owners of also owned 90% of CSGOLounge (match betting site)

is it weird that I wish the camera was in the stands (instead of the center stage)? So hard to actually watch gameplay via this.

Alright, did some more digging - his name is Eric Martin and he only spent $18K to win the contest...
Shout out to the guy/girl that won the referral competition last year. (100k shares is no joke)
just sucks for investors deploying a lot of $$$ into the space, only for their teams to basically be amateur teams now.
people are torn, but that's set into place by the gaming pubs. Ideally, there would be set franchises that held the seats.
end of the season and didn't place high enough.
The current structure of (esports in general) is flawed and discourages outside investors.
.@NRGgg (Shaq, A-Rod, Jimmy Rollins, etc.), and (Bundesliga League team: both got relegated.
Today is going to go down as a monumental day for esports. Two teams that received significant outside investments got relegated from LCS.
I also respect the hell out of Twitter for finding and scooping up Periscope/Vine so early. So much respect for and team!
touche. I think FB's corp dev is doing an incredible job, in this era. Oculus + Instagram.
YouTube still the best, IMO.
haha, didn't see this. Definitely expect a ton of people to tweeting this.

😱 my prediction is opposite haha. I think engagement rules for influencers. In the same way Instagram "killed" Vine.
I've never gotten called for jury duty, but you've convinced me to fight the stigma. I'm sort of excited now...
💪👌😍
Ah, I'm saying you can still see who they follow, there just won't be a hard number count shown.
right now, Instagram in theory puts a cap on the number of people you want to follow. (Because of the following/follower ratio)
Even more of a long-shot prediction -- 

Within the next 12 months, Instagram will remove "following" count and keep follower count.
After J.Dilla passed away, his Uncle created a doughnut business in his memory. https://t.co/cnVckHNpCJ
ah, definitely meant to imply celebrities when saying influencers.
on SC, I just say screw it when I'm craving more content. This is just something FB is sooooo good at. Always providing more content
interesting side note is that because discovery is easier on Insta, I've found myself following more ppl after watching all stories.
+1, have seen so many celebs and people already talk about how their engagement is immediately higher on Instagram.
Psttt... Check out https://t.co/ikP85KIAZy
ah, I'm saying the actual emojis/stickers you can send via chat and add to photos. The geo-filters are photo filters.
I know, I'm going to have to torrent it - wish I could just support Frank directly.
block button is better 😉
you can buy geo-filters, but not stickers to my knowledge?
In other news, Snapchat is slowly paving the way to start monetizing via sponsored stickers. https://t.co/tZvpsP91IC
haha, they likely will. I don't think it's as simple as that. It's arguably more valuable to grow Insta following vs. SC
😂 I don't use Instagram at all. Last post was &gt;6 months ago.
Prediction --

Instagram: will be the main place to watch influencer stories. (Engagement + discovery)

Snapchat: Friends stories.

yeah, supposedly they are known for being terrible to their community. (According to Ingress players)
https://t.co/u1G2PGWh0W - they have basically managed their community terribly.
ha, exactly my thoughts. Especially when the use-case is appealing to hardcore fans.
check out the: PokemonGo subreddit or just search PokemonGo on Twitter. It's a 💩-storm.
they aren't fixing any bugs, they removed the nearby feature entirely and are blocking apps like Pokevision.
Niantic is cannibalizing their brand, and losing some of their most engaged users/advocates by remaining silent.
highly recommend trying out Outlook for Mail + Calendar.

Exactly, wanted to show outsiders that if you're a big enough pub - owning distribution can make a ton of sense.
Neither of their games are played as Tier 1 right now, as you know, but..by owning the distribution - they have more flexibility.
I really just wanted to show outsiders that other distribution platforms exist (and that Ubisoft &amp; EA) specifically broke theirs off
Really appreciate it!

something tells me early Everquest players would say the same. 😉

Worth noting that is technically a co-owner (and on the cap table) of a VC backed esports team:
😱🙌👊 props!
oh man, I'm a GN3. What rank are you Rafael?
fair, the only tie to esports here is that Tmartn is technically a "co-owner" of EnvyUs (a team recently backed by VCs)
😂😂😂 better? I'm keeping my followers informed on the drama: https://t.co/pjhmdOA0tY
And questionably rigged the results of their bets on streams and videos. I really hope they face jail time (or at least lose their channels)

the space is so raw/early - it's hard to say. Most players are extremely volatile right now too. (1 season contracts)

depends on the game, but groups are actually pretty active on Steam. Also, inventories, screenshots, and achievements = social IMO
Did I mention that they also own their community marketplace for virtual items? Taking 10% off the top for all transactions.
They have: Groups, Profiles, Screenshots, Activity Feeds, etc.

They also did $3.5bn in sales last year, and have over 350M games available.

yes! is a huge market - because Valve doesn't let you sell skins for more than $400(?)

in theory "Google Now" is a competitor to Amazon Echo, right? Just a matter of building some hardware that does Google Now.

This is amazing. Well done https://t.co/XOWIAJziOn
thanks! :)
what is that computer under your iPad? Looks pretty corporate to me. 😜

yoooo
I'll chat/call in tomorrow - let me know what time you are on. :P

yup, and it's seems like it's always the companies that are overlooked.
I genuinely don't think that the subreddit was built for discoverability. It was built to get ideas and communicate with creators.
Reddit isn't real-time. Discussion can happen over days. Curation is an issue, but their products are built to be self-curated.
that's a whole other topic, but I'd personally argue that's not what their focus should be. Twitter/Periscope = best at real-time
Reddit has built in ranking system for curation - why not leverage it? We both know the discussions can't scale on solely TWTR.
Why not give content creators a place to collaborate and share ideas? has https://t.co/hjC36vZFEj and it's amazing.
really? I don't think creating a subreddit is a sign of failure. They are working with content creators. [cont.]
Tasty and Nifty (@BuzzFeed) consistently kill it on FB with beautiful, engaging videos.

15 hours later and he is still steaming... https://t.co/FLKvpTPjiM
Thoughts and prayers with Brussels. Spent some time there last summer, a truly beautiful city.

yeah, pretty unrealistic. His team is one of the best though. If you're on a top 8 team, you're considered "Pro"
ya, he's not nearly as good as he used to be. (Was once a pro, but "retired" about a year ago)
actually it ranges from $5-$20 a person. They are probably doing $20.
had to drive home, so not watching. But I'm assuming it is Money 8s? It's $5 a person via
haha - $100 is pretty cheap for the exposure you would get as the "Top Donator"
he's in shock and flustered - don't think he was expecting this turnout - pretty surreal to watch haha.
He signed an exclusive contract with https://t.co/2Fyq55LVRQ and got stuck streaming on there.
Pretty funny because he can *technically* get banned from Twitch he doesn't start playing a game pretty soon.
Is he going to break 100k? He deserves this more than anyone, so happy for https://t.co/D7U8hCyr0O
completely agree, he's making *a lot* of money tonight. Someone just donated $100, haha
they all gave him $5 haha, it's only fair
A bit long (and old), but check this out: https://t.co/Zk8yf27zIz
He has a crazy history of going from nothing (working at McDonalds) to now having over 3M YT subscribers.
He used to be a huge professional COD player, won a bunch of championships, XGames, etc.
https://t.co/2Fyq55LVRQ basically died and they wouldn't let him out of the contract. Publicly shamed them, finally got out of it.
He basically signed an extremely long contract to exclusively stream with https://t.co/2Fyq55LVRQ, which hurt his viewership a ton.
Over 60k...wow.
Yup, over 60k now. He's incredible, not sure if you know the backstory or not - but got stuck in a contract with MLG.
At close to 20K live viewers, and he hasn't even went live yet. #TheReturnToTwitch  https://t.co/qSXkdSKnlj
yo, willing to step in - if you need help. DM.
https://t.co/fBuowe2hG4
One. More. Thing. Plz...
Over/Under 100k live viewers for #TheReturn? https://t.co/pJAfPtV7H6
please just follow really random companies, just to throw things off.
What did I start? 😳😜
talk to HR, file a complaint for harassment.

CONFETTI FAV!

I alway say it, but it's true: I don't think I would be where I am at today - without Twitter. I got 4 internships via Twitter. #LoveTwitter
it's the bomb.
It's going to be a big one, a "major" for CS:GO.
I'm leaning towards 3 - as the one I disagree with most. Especially if rumors of Messenger Marketplace are true.
Who is going to Columbus? Thinking about making the trip.
oh man, the Carbon and Str8 Rippin days. 🙌🏻🔥
Denial looked *a lot* better than Allegiance.

Twitter, Spotify, Outlook, Snapchat, Messenger
Unreal match. is a god amongst men.
Ready Player One? Also, currently reading Leading.
In all seriousness, this is why I love March. I'm not going to pretend it doesn't sting. But Middle Tennessee deserved that W.
figured I'd start it off.
.@Besvinick because I know it's coming. 😭

Welp...officially taking a break from social media for the next 24-48hrs.
I believe...if not - the whole city of East Lansing might be on fire.

just have to believe, i guess...
fam!...uh...Go Green?
