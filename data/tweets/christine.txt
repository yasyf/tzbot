Utterly ridiculous to have $6K of repairs for things that shouldn't break at &lt;25K. Of course, warranty period has expired.
My Miata required, in 15 yrs, 1 clutch ($750 parts/labor) and 2 O2 sensors ($250 parts/labor ea). We still drive it. WTF,
At &lt;25K miles: new timing chain, $1500; clutch (a 3rd one), $1800; flywheel, $1000; control arm, $650; battery/load test, $250. Joke.
I need $6000 of repairs for wear and tear on a with &lt; 25K miles. (The dealer quoted more.) What a piece of crap, never buying again.
