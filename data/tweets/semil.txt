Q for those who practice "Inbox Zero" - where do you put the emails you need to deal with? Do you just move them back to inbox next day?

that is epic. also, expect to see my name in the inbox this evening

**Will post full thoughts on Snap tonight.
yes sure lots of aspiration but I am specifically looking for behaviors rooted in fear
but who would be motivated by fear to act here?
yes!! great call.
but‚Ä¶. With more media telecom consolidation, might be renewed interest and even more M&amp;A
yes - how will they respond?
interesting - do you see fear behaviors there? would love to hear more
companies - Auto OEMs afraid tech co‚Äôs will eat their lunch; Adv mfg afraid that new processes will change work fundamentally
explain the fear to me
this is partly why many pro VCs are careful about who they meet, ignore email, etc.
Industries which feel the *most fear* right now:
-Consumer retail
-Auto manufacturing
-Advanced manufacturing
-_________? (Please cite why)
* for co‚Äôs a VC meets, sure; but not emails that pile up, which is humanely impossible
josh‚Äôs tweet is about something else
most who opt for it are this way, schools judged on job rate post-grad; Stanford tried opposite &amp; lost many corporates
he‚Äôs talking about a founder acknowledging getting a ‚Äúno‚Äù from VC
I guess I don‚Äôt think 2-3 weeks to pass and then writing a thoughtful email warrants a burned bridge
all decisions &amp; calendar items should have some form of 2FA to get to ‚Äúyes‚Äù
I know but some people compartmentalize and it can take a bit more; sender feels guilt so wants acknowledgement
the most quiet and humanity hasn't ruined the day yet.
could be a 3-4 week grace period here, as folks are rushing to close other things. but a pro always closes, at some point.
lol - great call!

This week's magazine covers from around the world stack up like a bad deck of Tarot cards.
Guess who didn't get text spam from ChitChat? Bill Belichick. #snapface #instantchat
This storm of real-time reporting via social media is being exploited like a smoke bomb: use the smoke distract audience from other moves.

c'mon man, that's SnapDynamics!
no, no... i meant in general, using PR. your story synthesized a lot of disparate data points that signal growth issues.
not sure. why would they allow $FB and Instagram?
any links?
not making an emotional argument. I wouldn't settle either. I get it.
Issue for $FB when it went public? Mobile.
Issue for $SNAP when it goes public? Instagram.

(Not a Snap hater, btw. Want them to do well.)

the main point of that was very important as we go from campaign to governance

This weekend started w/ Trump‚Äôs inauguration and ends w/ Brady &amp; Belichick headed to their seventh Super Bowl.
this weekend began w/ Trump and may end w/ Belichick.
he is a great hacker. great player, thinker, improviser.
i feel the same way personally but for a different very type of work.
all part of the strategy. even past facts are up for debate. just about winning an argument w/ any tactics.
the real debate was over facts vs reality as we transition from campaign to governance. crowd size just happened to be the topic
not only metric, believe me! it's about all time great. again, I think he will be there.
we can get reductionist on everyone then! doesn't hold water. ftr rodgers will be on the list in either 3 weeks or 3 years.
i respect your opinion but can't understand why (right now) many would rank Aikman lower. smh! kelly's feat was incredible.
agree he will, be, but you'd knock off one of these? Brady Montana Elway Peyton Unitas Bradshaw Aikman Marino Staubach Kelly Favre
not scientific, but many respected investors are chasing them based on real, true growth.
best mental trick I've heard a/b "letting it go" is like a snake sheds its skin (still hard to do tho!)
stats are a part of the ingredients, not the only ingredient.
um....
yes, i can see that. only saying right now, not a Top 10. but will be.
impressive. also, romo. i do think he's great and will get there.
few more seasons more likely
i agree he will!
that's not the point. never said he was broke.
agree. just talking about this season, right now, moment in time
prolly 2-3 more years, maybe 3 weeks :-)
over Aikman?!?!?!
not judging one game. he will be top 10 at the end. but not yet.
agree!
wow - link?
Favre, Jim Kelly, Aikman, Staubach?
quite possibly
I would never bet against him.
you're saying all-time? So Brady, Montana, Bradshaw, Marino, Elway, Peyton Manning, Unitas.... and he's on that list?
like Big Ben a lot, but let's revisit in a few weeks
yes but the chatter this week was strange.
That is crazy, sorry.
I like Pack + Rodgers, but this is what happens when everyone starts saying Rodgers is a Top 10 all-time QB. He's great, but No.
just did a long one w/ - as for - what topics?
oh. well..... muy slick!
hello..... new site!
the model of being independent, vertical focus, and having a data network effect across customers to always improve
sure. not sure if "incompetent" is right word. it's something entirely different.

2/ Two great tips for email newsletter brevity from crowd - enlist a friend to edit it for you; and impose character limit on your curation.
no, that's a bit different, but generally people recommend people, and hard to get a negative rec.
yes! omg. yes.
working it through. so far, i've asked those making intros to write a brief 1-paragraph recommendation for the person.
w/ consequences!
yes, but 1/ if i don't click or read; and 2/ if I subscribe, what's the point? also, i lose respect for your work
i wish i knew. typing it out to develop an answer. could be evaluator needs more precise heuristic of what sources matter.
2/ Everyone can intro everyone to everyone else. Easy to find a positive reference or rec, so currency of value &amp; signal diminishes.
As startup culture pervades more industries &amp; everyone is in "ecosystem" it changes conventional currency of personal/company references.
i like them - extra layer of filter before clicking &amp; committing.
yes he respects his audience in this way.
bingo. you nailed it.
I have an honest question for everyone (especially journalists) writing email newsletters -- WHY are they SO LONG? Brevity wins.
i started using mac apps to conserve - spotify, mail, wunderlist

not saying they're bad, it's more about lack of experience (me included) &amp; structural capacity, deep pockets, etc
tons of $, tons of new funds, tons of structures, multiple checkpoints, funds not big enough to be creative.
only talking A and beyond -- seed is a crapshoot.
not w/ my own eyes but I'm sure it's happened.
professional, proven VCs at Series A and beyond. Seed more of wild west, no fixed checkpoint, etc.
for ex: does founder need $300k secondary cash for down payment on home? build syndicate to look toward next round, etc.
4/ Will often gather 100s of data points on particulars of founders/team to structure fair deal upfront, minimize negotiation &amp; show faith.
ha. emojis so much more efficient.
Whatever. If an investor can't handle personal side of losing in competition, they're in wrong business.
yes, that's a surefire way to get a bag of flaming poop sent to your door.
totally understand. i think of it like milk -- great for a few days, maybe weeks -- but can get sour.
ha. yeah i think there's a line b/w "take your time" vs shopping on the street. that's not welcomed.
3/ Will often (not always track or get to know founders for up to a year before a deal happens.
2/ In competitive deal, genuinely want founders to pitch other VCs they respect. Comfortable w/ competition.
Characteristics I've observed among many (not all) proven tech VCs. 1/ Genuinely happy for founders if startup doesn't need venture $.
not so simple. recent example: CNN report on Tue - verified? what does CIA/FBI know? record of who was briefed? all hazy.
lotsa new finds out there
who feels bad about it?
yes, if just looking at end values &amp; speed; if looking at pomp of IPO, airbnb will &amp; that's fine.
doesn't matter. airbnb alone can be a $300B+ company. also, the class that will was founded in 2008-2012 so still time.

yeah no argument there but nuanced diff b/w relateIQ and Trello board :-)
not a quantity game. just heard GP who‚Äôll have his 1st liquidity ever in 7 yr career in 2017 - $2b+ cash back
what works well? In practice doesn‚Äôt seem to work across funds b/c many GPs keep sources close/private
so that wasn‚Äôt factored into money listed it raised? (honest question, I just don‚Äôt know) what would you ballpark as total?
ya that‚Äôs bonkers! I just meant for Trello taking in $10 and churning out $425 ain‚Äôt too shabby.
only joking - it was fun. What app?
ok I‚Äôll email you to clarify on the math
oh wow! putting my vote here for a Feld Thoughts treatment on this - would love to hear/read the stories.
ok beyond that - say, like Ipsy which has negative working capital, etc. how would VC investment qualify (not counting breakouts)
not bad game theory there. maybe not even run as he doesn‚Äôt need to subject himself to another test at risk of losing
100% he gave a talk at post seed 2014 (youtube) on education that blew me away

Twitter is a mechanism to release steam and vent.
Twitter is at it best and worst right now.

ha! folks at remark they often invest today in what was hot 2 years ago (after hype cycle).
a lof of what you're smartly highlighting happens naturally *if* you meet w/ creators &amp; other investors often &amp; listen.
i think they need to stop this game before someone is critically injured. seriously.
some (not all) will also idump ~$1M preemptively into portfolio co uncapped w/ discount
it is certainly possible
agree in theory but plenty of cases out here seen up close in syndicated rounds where that isn't reality
when a round goes right to a big VC, many (not all) aren't allowed to take pro rata.
right, so i think this applies to smaller % of true lead/colead "institutional" seed funds who know this, not majority
they're there. do you see everyone getting their pro rata?
i'd say very few of 350+ smaller funds do + allocations of course not always granted in future competitive rounds.
it may. structurally, don't think it will. best VCs will want to manage own fund alongside LPs in shared risk model
good eye. it is. but LPs like pooled risk to align incentives, tho better (yet perverse) incentive to SPV on top
6/ Anyway, I could keep going b/c the post is rich w/ amazing info, but do read it if you're new (like me) to investing OPM &amp; want to grow.
5/ Structural caveat to Fred's post: Even if a small/new VC has reserves, they may not be able to get future allocation. Very few can &amp; do.
4/ Just as many work in industry to "get operational experience," LPs like new VCs out of existing funds b/c they're exposed to fund mgmt.
3/ I wish Fred had written this 3 years ago ;-) Three items in here are definitely the hardest concepts to grasp, even harder to execute on.
2/ Many professional LPs nervous a/b new VCs (myself included) b/c fund mgmt knowledge usually can only be learned being inside a big fund.

fair. on 2, so what? aren't there rolexes and timex watches? on 3, SF always been pushing cultural envelope
they invented the comms channels, no permission req'd. we are free to let go of them.
i agree. what would you point to as the Top 3 perceived or true wrongs?
that's more an issue of education, and capitalism itself. but yes, high inequality historically also brings nasty times.
5/ I'd say "tech" actually should &amp; will have higher approval than predictors believe -- it's capitalism itself which may be questioned.
4/ Of course, tech incumbents should get proactively involved in policy/debates re: training future generations &amp; engaging more citizens.
3/ Like politics, people vote w/ their feet, eyes, taps, attention. Will others stop using Google Apps or FB or put down their phones?
2/ Info, networks, maps, transit options, communications tools etc all at our fingertips, relatively cheaply. Yes, GOOG execs are rich, so?
1/ Predictions re tech industry backlash &amp; "villain" label = tired, lazy narrative. Tech co's not perfect, but we all benefit greatly.
neither, just more about how a seed VC should view markets before or after, but of course, not scientific.

yes read that one. i do agree, yet every year, i just see more money being parked around me for a long time. tricky.
not sure i follow, can you explain a bit more?
4/ Those smaller investors who keenly pick who to keep backing w/ $ &amp; supporting based on faith/belief vs hardcore metrics will be rewarded.
3/ Moreover, an opening to invest may not be entirely based on "is it growing fast right now?" Smaller funds have more leeway here.
2/ That may mean, a small good startup gets $1M here, $500k later there &amp; so forth. VC$ will need to be more supportive, in smaller chunks.
1/ Thinking: One change for small &amp; big VCs now is, after being spoiled by rapid growth, now many good things will simply take care &amp; time.
yes, good distinction &amp; framing.
right. agree -- at some point, have to grow up. (same analogy for funds which get bigger &amp; need more ownership!)
all of this is true but we have to remember many early stage co's need to start somewhere, then hopefully move up curve.
wow nice, you went for the combined approach -- congrats!

sure, but folks can learn it, too. again, a founder may want a "mix" on the BoD.
no, meant term of "operator" is squishy.
no, i'm saying when that person has options, they aren't always driven by VC sales b/c they know their tech
yes, many variants on the hustle &amp; also a team of diff backgrounds can support others well, seen this work
i don't disagree but also worth noting it is a squishy term &amp; not clearly defined
i've found it's really person-dependent &amp; not generalizable. seeing one now &amp; very people-driven.
some didn't on that list. is working 2 yrs "opex" - i know the profiles.
#s matter less when considering who the leads in the big winners are or will be.
we could go on about it, but Fenton, Gurley, Sze, Wilson, Mamoon etc -- limited if any per today's parlance.
will always be tough to discern b/c of external forces ("so many funds!" etc), so maybe just pegged to big drivers/outcomes.
that has been the case in the current era of true VC leaders in eyes of LPs &amp; results -- most had very minimal "opex" if any
yes, also a rapidly changing space &amp; winner(s) not clear yet outside of VC valuations
ugh. i know. had seed in hand &amp; balked b/c couldn't grasp it in moment. very nice/humble founders.

7/ Country hasn't been able to stop threats, whether physical or digital, from entering the state or information networks.
6/ i'm no expert here, but from talking to a few CSOs, Security tech founders - no way to block, can only notify when intruders are present.
5/ Info interference recently caused by foreign states? Or rogue actors? Or 400lb neckbeard hacker? No policy framework or tech to thwart.
4/ 9-11 caused by distributed network, results in Patriotic Act + "War On Terror." Counterterrorism efforts adjusted, but it keeps going.
3/ Yet, would argue largest "tech story" in 2017 is ramifications of state-sponsored interference in communications (including elections).
no, depends. folks invest today looking out w/o regarding macro, of course; but if you're selling, you look now

Ha not for me. But many ways to use Twitter, which is the beauty of it
5/ This then places premium value on investor‚Äôs track record, network, and strength of each connection. An engaged network trumps marketing.
4/ Over time, investors who survive often don‚Äôt need to engage in marketing. Instead, their brand coyly baits others to market for them.
3/ Yet after a while, it‚Äôs a small world, and data emerges. Marketing can be built &amp;/or gamed, but branding brutally tied to outcomes.
2/ Marketing oneself as an investor works, it‚Äôs low-hanging fruit, cheap tools available. It provides a reasonable runway to get liftoff.
Many tech investors conflate marketing w/ brand. It‚Äôs relatively easy to market via basic tactics, hard to build a brand &amp; requires time.

co-location model is ready for case study treatment - i find it very interesting SF + _____. Likely enough #s to look at stats
oh yes wasn‚Äôt alluding to ‚Äúpedigree‚Äù but more location of HQ
sounds like they're split offices SF + another city, which makes more sense.
went off CB &amp; social media profiles. is the setup SF + other city?
Interesting: The few hot/growing mobile video chat apps (Tribe, Marco, HouseParty, __?) all HQ'd in SF Bay Area. Wouldn't have assumed that.
not sure i follow what you're saying but feel free to ping me anytime.
from your fingertips to god's ears!
i am not. easy to market yourself, hard to find very good investments b/c they're competitive, hard to drive a return.
happy to have my butt saved ;-)
4/ And if this happens as a sort of wave where buyers are influenced by &amp;/or copy others, could be a huge shot in arm for all stakeholders.
3/ When these happen, most are at outcome levels which wouldn't be worth a large VC fund's time/money. So helpful to smaller funds...
2/ I've witnessed this w/ Haystack. Co's get interest from strategics, then maybe a little investment, then maybe a lead round, and then...

we won‚Äôt know for a few years at least; derivative question is also on fund by fund level do the economics work
I still use physical notebooks and paper
happy to brainstorm
even more than 2! I had this thought when wiring funds to startups, lotsa 2FA, so why not for our most valuable asset?
fewer meetings, long meetings, more time in between meetings

I wish it were more high-tech (something I‚Äôd like to fund); low tech: EA empowered to constantly audit calendar &amp; block out time etc
yes that‚Äôs a good nuanced one, indeed
for sure. I was mainly trying to address why there‚Äôs an explosion of firms beyond what many believe is ‚Äúplenty‚Äù

is it unfair that I found that question from him very strange? I mean, hundreds of great posts have been written already on this

i'm thinking more on a fund by fund basis, which is how the money multiplies
no, that‚Äôs besides the main point which is for me to focus the time I have on exactly what matters to me
thanks. to date tbh it‚Äôs been pretty free form, but now time to grow up a bit
yes with 3 kids and easy to fall into trap of meetings, being physically away forces a different kind of work zone
ha!!! so this EA has full license to challenge me on every merting and blocking out time chunks
I hired an EA to meet me on Sundays and go over each meeting on my calendar and each hour block of time all week
on my iPhone dock tray

i realize it's in conflict w/ photo ephemerality. was a thought i had about poor state of consumer storage options.
no offense taken, just challenging your assumption. i know why ppl use it; "wacky" idea result of hardware + poor consumer choices
sorta, but I was more thinking of a direct marketing challenge on owning a camera + pain of storage options facing consumers.
how long? enough to get into real chat? Would it be long enough to force you remember to follow-up? Would your mind be on next task?

read all of them: https://t.co/L8A3IFCcTx (please make to read 'em all before assuming you know what i think)
hmmmm..... that assumes one would allow deviation from said plans, which is where I think most of this breaks down in practice.
a bit, yes; thought occurred to me more b/c of craziness of options/prices offered by incumbent consumer players.
i actually do, if you care to research: https://t.co/MdQWBJ8TMk (more a comment about consumer storage UX patterns)
"Snapchat Vault." but yeah, the incumbents UX is so bad &amp; manipulative, it creates even this kind of off-brand opportunity
agree w/ you in theory, but in practice, yeah -- optimizing schedule shortens serendipity's aperture
oh. oops! probably too wacky. (too much wine, too)
Wacky idea I had driving up north: Snapchat markets Spectacles + free unlimited lifetime web/mobile photo archive. Lock-in users for life.
it's not black/white, just about scale. planning to go downtown is 2/10, but hitting 8 stores + lunch date = 9/10.
most seeking office need media to get attention; this time around, most media needed Donald to get attention.
The more you plan, the less serendipity you can experience.

for sure, but i see so many CEOs raising (and investors raising funds) too easily &amp; can be taken for granted when $ is easy

there should be some standardized metric for evaluating someone's resourcefulness. maybe (results/capital spent)/time ?
I thought a/b this b/c in catching up w/ friend tonight, he mentioned of an old famous VC he worked for that "____ would never take a zero."
When it's easy to raise $ or you're not the one doing it, it's easier to spend it, and perhaps to not fight against any possible "zeroes."

I hear you. Interesting that many friends deep in blockchain world also feel similarly re 1997, tho maybe that‚Äôs 1993.

which one is which for you? :-)
Diff POVs. 1/ blockchain may have an easier time slope out of disillusionment, yet 2/ AI is already driving value.
how so or examples?
but even some great investors chase the growth. perhaps risk is hedged a bit by being in a basket with 20-ish others

Somehow this assembled at my home desk, but it also makes perfect sense https://t.co/uuLrtsIxS1
in theory, sure, but raising $3m pre/early product is a diff game than raising $500k; ultimately, comes down to philosophy
2/ this happens quite often. i commit to round raising X at Y cap. team gets interest &amp; blows past X. not crying, but here we are
1/ there are so many edge cases, none too alike -- that's my point, every investor, every startup = special snowflake üòÄ
always agree w/ you in theory, but reality  demonstrated multiple edge cases - say, startups that just keep raising $m's on caps
or protecting against raising too much, or against getting diluted, or ......
no shame in anything, so long as both sides are real about what's working &amp; what isn't.

can you explain a bit more? not sure i follow here.
3a/ I used to think reason some Series A VCs don't allow pro-rata was to eat all ownership, but now I think it's to silence nippy voices.

yep looked it up def one of those.
both modes are req'd. twitter actually acts as a safe outlet for an introvert, but can also lift up the extrovert ahead of schedule
many do comment the weeks can be so social, their downtown is by contrast very anti-social
can‚Äôt remember, likely ‚Äò84-85 model i‚Äôd guess
agree &amp; both great points

5/ That's all I have for now. It struck me. This is a successful GP, for sure. Was a fascinating convo &amp; couldn't help but overhear it. /fin
4/ Introversion, this GP said, also needed to focus on the long time cycle, the patience needed, to focus on exec team &amp; company health.
3/ GP stressed introversion req'd b/c at time of investment, many risks float around &amp; many peers will snicker about your deals.
2/ What struck me is GP stressed VC may seem best suited for extroverts, but w/ experience now believes it is for introvert's world.
Quick thoughtstorm b4 I head out to dinner. 1/ This month, I was in a VC office &amp; OH'd a particular (successful) GP giving career advice.
how do i find my purchased movies?
My 1st computing device was an Atari. My daughter's (now 3.5 yo) was iPod 4thG; my twin sons' (now 14 mo's) will be an Echo Dot.
i could go on about Apple, but I won't b/c I am going to go out to dinner w/ my lady, which is a rare treat.
screaming kids = apple fan boys üòÄ
v1 was B+, now this is a major step backward. i'd say same for most (not all) of latest iOS UI, as well.
looks good. but i was stuck &amp; couldn't find  purchased movies, which almost caused a tantrum (daughter, frozen).
how do I get to my movie library? I‚Äôm stuck on the ‚ÄúSully‚Äù page

yes. issue is the spectrum of what each term can really man.
dunno. I think of power law as related to outcomes. the best investors seem to be able to find monopolies.
"special situations"
haha, love that emoji. well-played.
ya. this is what says. not trying to make it more complex, but just saying "startup" or "VC" isn't descriptive enough.
sure, can be simplified (as you suggest) or expanded. i am saying "new" or revised, not necessarily "many."
yep. as sector grows, just saying X doesn't always mean the same thing in language. multiple interpretations.
Investing pre-product is talent arbitrage. Investing pre-product-market fit is market arbitrage.
Based on Q4 deals I've observed, a high-caliber enterprise tech startup team w/ SF/Valley experience can fetch $10M+ in funding pre-product.
The words of startups - ‚Äúfounder‚Äù ‚Äústartup‚Äù ‚ÄúVC‚Äù ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù etc - could mean too many things to use w/ precision. Need a new lexicon.
i thought the same until i realized it would take 31 EC flips in a few key states + EC members chosen by party itself
nah, majority in house/senate are taking power, not looking at any constitutional crisis. EC vote likely just a formality.
it's on a constitutional crisis (i guess?) if those in house/senate deem there is one, but right now, majority rules.
hard to prove latter; former is a false argument.

depends on stage; those w/ more than clear PM fit (very few) clearly not available then. but that's a small slice.

ha! but for realz, the costs (inputs) rising locally but not sure on output. I think it means other markets will attract VC model
sure but there are $250m ones and $20b+ ones. depending on fund size, former can matter a great deal (I know you know)

I wish I didn‚Äôt feel this, but‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs hard to move to Bay Area now as a young startup w/o 12+ months runway and/or close to PM-fit.

That works, too - keep it on device and go through the longer pitch if the person wants it. Need materials to suit each context.

outside of purely breaking law (which is obvious), not sure what else one can do. social pressures don't seem to apply anymore.
Trying to hold politicians &amp; appointees "accountable" in a post-fact world is futile. Only tools for accountability are courts &amp; elections.

well said, bill.
argument of ant-FB folks is social proof trumps that &amp; ppl won't decipher. also, plenty of op-ed garbage on real news sites
argument is pure size of their influence &amp; audience, power, etc.
argument is w/ 250M+ DAU's in USA + algo newsfeed + desire to monetize engagement, sensationalist news pays off.
it's a gray area. what if my blog was not verified but TC is?
does that go against "platform" DNA?
well, why now then? everything was cool until tuesday?
genuine question - should they play a role in arbitrating truth, fact?
wow, i didn't realize how many people are lashing out against $fb's newsfeed. i hear you!
understood. so is answer for platform to stop me from reposting anything, or downweighting it in the feed of others?
to be clear, i'm not a fan of this new world so far.
i hear you on the broad point &amp; their power, tho seems like a stretch for crowd to assert it was a cause of Tue
right. more finger-pointing vs looking deeply within. maybe just that stage of anguish.
yes, i understand. but do we have to go there for news or to inform ourselves? (that's just my broader question)
totally understand. same could happen on a blog w/ Disqus comments. Or Twitter. Or Reddit. etc.
yes, but broader question is - why rely on it this much - that's only info source for citizens?
could've happened in a pre-social world -- email chains. fwiw had plenty of "other side" news/convos in my feed
i have many GOP friends, i saw all their news and convos.
ok, but even if, why go there to get informed about politics or issues? also, conversations among friends are better there
i saw plenty of diverse new sources in my feed + conversations. why get news from $FB then?
mine wasn't an echo - went to grad school w/ many GOPers. i saw it all.
b/c it's not the root cause of the problem.
ok but both are free will choices.
decentralization + waning power of traditional institutions (and alliances)
yes, get her on the bench of candidates asap.
Watching Monday morning finger-pointing at $FB is amusing. I didn't want Tue's outcome, but we have free will to choose our info sources.
for him, not sure, but in general, yes -- that's why they need to start now.
that's why they need to scout &amp; groom right now.
all eyes on 2019. let's see.
dunno. maybe just monitor twitter daily ;-(
well, not this particular flavor (of course), but trend line w/ social media + TV + cult of personality seems there.
rules rewritten now.
how do super delegates factor in here? (genuinely curious)
we are due to catch up &amp; converse a/b this - never seen anything like this before.
i'm talking about the guy who won tuesday.
got it. but broader point holds true? seems like riding media notoriety now prereq for ability to compete nationally.
actually in watching older interviews of him, he actually does -- scary enough.
those specific folks, or broader trend?
you're more optimistic than i am.

fair point, but even w/o him i think of it as a trend.
I like him personally but every time I see him speak, no message, not crisp, and rambles. every single time.
New Reality: Mark Cuban probably now has a better shot of winning a Democratic primary versus a career politician (say, Cory Booker).
yes!
Thinking: In a post-fact world, we now have a wider aperture for political candidates including those w/ skeletons. More people can run.
and as per usual, sees through the forest. great insight.
just takes one piece of content, not a campaign.
yes
no, is talking a/b testing relevance. here, founder's email exposed deep enterprise need based on response level
yes. "content marketing' can be simply a brief email that's passed around. i diligenced a founder this way &amp; ended up investing.
absolutely! in current climate, no check on founders raising above initially stated goals. dangerous.
imo reading it point is to build vs complain, to accept this week's reality (w/in reason) &amp; leverage tech for future
not a valid argument IMO b/c all parties don't compete in specific states b/c of EC rules, so argument is moot.
dude. that was the issue this time. need a vigorous debate &amp; crafting of a durable message.
but their primary was still 15 deep. how could Dems even field 5 legit candidates right now?
i'd love to see it &amp; will root for it, but that is a tall order. but long run, yeah.
yes but might be too early for '20.
Castro definitely on the bench. Warren won't appeal in rust belt. Brown? meh. Obama can't do much now nor not sure he wants to.
yes, i think this may happen. let's see. but agree, yes.
i can say from seed POV raising over $2.9M &amp; not showing PM fit w/in 2 years raises big red flags w/ VCs
ok maybe then see who the Top 10 are and take a break. or start in Jan '17.
that's a detail i'm sure can be done in the end. right now, there's not even a bench!
wrong. it should be a bigger message than just an anti-____ message. that was 2016.
4/ Democrats should start their 2020 primary process now. No joke. It'll take a long time to whittle down to the right message &amp; candidate.
3/ Only leader w/ power left in opposition party is Sanders, who appears vigorous as ever. After that, there is no bench on Democratic side.
2/ Gingrich has experience &amp; will persuade Trump to be bold in 1st 100 days + hit back DC resistance. Focus will be on key campaign themes.

6/ Big driver 3 is demographics. We all know that one. Anyway, id recommend 45 mins to listen to Packer, he's really good. Thx
5/ Big driver 2 is microtargeting (Rove, Gingrich) + leveraging internet &amp; social media + ruthless delegitimizing of Dem POTUS figures.
4/ Big driver 1 is economic dislocation, rise of tech + Wall Street bailout '08 + college bubble = what we only start to see today...
3/ Packer alleges it started in '92 &amp; was bound to tip over. 2016 is just another point on a progression that'll take decades to iron out.
2/ re: Packer's interview, it's history most political observers already know, but he synthesizes &amp; threads his thesis in a powerful way.

i don't mind it but just noting the cultural/generational trend of including it right off the bat.
yep agree w/ you but i think there will be a cost for the last 3-5 years.
Email pitch checklist:
-Medium link
-10,000 characters in email
-Calend.ly link
-request meeting in 48hr window
i agree, but coming from Dept. of Labor side. TBD if they regulate investment vehicles or underlying companies.
already happening.
yep. this is where and why it's starting.
gray area when you're talking about some of the rounds last 2-3 years. don't know about the line.
they may regulate the funds themselves to audit over a certain amount.
it's also the size of the private investment rounds. e.g. if you raise $100M+ cash in private, that's like an IPO.
it's already in motion. kindling is a tussle b/w Dept of Labor (protecting employees) vs SEC in DC. Save my tweet.
yes, like many use Twitter, in fact.
As startups stay private longer &amp; as more money floods in, SEC will follow w/ new regulations. Startup reporting will be standardized.
dunno. maybe they get edited and/or feel compelled to be animated for betting metrics
haha. actually, the newsletter writing &amp; tone is much more interesting (often) than what they write online or tweets.
Reporters launch their own newsletters to (1) free themselves of editorial control, (2) grab subscribers, (3) ship text w/o obnoxious ads.
of course, have to keep investing, question is "Where"? see my pinned tweet.

i'm convinced that being able to taste food or wine requires a moment of isolation.
3/ This distorts traditional path startups have historically ventured on. A larger, softer safety net for failure, maybe local maxima, too.
yes. global economy centered around tech/networks, and that tech/network concentrated in Bay Area + China.
2/ Right or wrong, diverse motivations of capital sources  lead to more co's, longer runways, inflation, and potentially flatter returns.
New $ in SF Bay isn't all focused on pure financial return. Some sources prioritize deal flow, access, early M&amp;A, and learning the market.
GOP is masterful at painting any opponent as weak or flawed. not many are able to artfully punch back.

what a lucky investor to be with all three of those co's
Gurley on China: Amazing companies, innovative in their own way, exec talent, huge market -- they visit annually. #WSJDLive
Gurley: Current environment for huge tech co's w/ big cash pile, may see more M&amp;A if prices drop, Corp Dev teams enjoy new stakes. #WSJDLive
Gurley: If non-US co's are acquired, might see American co's lobby government to protect home turf. #WSJDLive
Fang Bao: Chinese M&amp;A in U.S. may increase, best core tech located here. #WSJDLive
Fang Bao: The non-Uber but good co's may look to 2018-19 for IPO b/c of strength of next year's IPO pipeline. #WSJDLive
Gurley: 2017 IPO pipeline should be extremely strong, gives a VERY strong hint will go out in 2017. #WSJDLive
Gurley: Record (paper returns) &amp; also low liquidity, never seen this divergence before + bad incentives to poorly mark illiquid assets.
Fang Bao: Money in China looking for RMB diversification. Worldwide, currency diversification is trumping seeking highest returns. #WSJDLive
Gurley: Global interest rates so low, leads to massive asset bubbles across sectors where "money is looking for a home." #WSJDLive
Gurley: Most IPOs coming to market w/ massive losses b/c w/ low capex, no where else to put the money. #WSJDLive
Gurley: Increase in bankruptcies, but no bust, now TONS of new (less educated) money injected - therefore no corrective mechanism.
Will soon live-tweet final VC panel #WSJDLive which includes Then flying home late tonight.

I have done this before. Can share
they don't matter that much &amp; he may not actually know enough to say in this case
can't speak for Steve, but what could he really say that matters vs just "no comment"? founders control the co.
even if he said its bad, then what? look I agree w/ you overall but only board has agency to crack whip
he said the first and second; maybe doesn't know enough to say third
to what end tho? it's just words. can't just clawback. Public assumes VCs have more influence than they really do
talk to me when the bot makes money for the firm :-)
a non-board VC can't really do much w/o control
Lee: "I believe in activist-VC. We need to stay involved." In response to tense exchange on VC role in policing Theranos-es. #WSJDLive
Lee: China investors are looking globally for RMB diversification, looking for talent, brands, new market expansion, AI/ML. #WSJDLive
Jurvetson: 2015 private investment in space tech was more than all history before it, times 2. #WSJDLive
Atomico: Tech in Berlin, Porto, Scandanavia able to build products for global audience b/c of culture of growing up traveling. #WSJDLive
Lee on China: 800m PC penetration China, 300m millennials, huge aging population, digital natives, inventing new biz models. #WSJDLive
Rolfe asks $ question - most AI picks &amp; shovels get acquired but not $FB returns. Jurvetson says it's a time to learn for VCs. #WSJDLive
Lee: Incumbents bring more capital, can spillover into other adjacent (drones) &amp; traditional categories (health/ed). #WSJDLive
Automakers making moves, but still laggards says Jurveston, who invested in Tesla + also more stealth co's in AI/mobility. #WSJDLive
Jurvetson: AI term overused, really "machine intelligence" w/ deep learning; marriage of networking, chips, CPU. Will ripple.#WSJDLive
Atomico: IoT 30bn devices + AI on top transforming every sector. #WSJDLive
Lee: Next 5yrs 2bn smartphones will go to 4bn; growth will be in India, SE Asia + vertical services to boost installed bases. #WSJDLive

which device did you boy?
part of the reason I am curious about Pixel is nearly every nontech normal friend I have hates iOS 10
been thinking chrome book too
iMessage by far the one app which binds users to iOS the most
if you're tied into Google Apps &amp; storage, tighter integration from calendar to maps to future predictive services etc
how long did it take to arrive? what do you miss most about iPhone?
did you junk iPhone or now rock two phones?
same but I just use 10-12 apps now

It's all moving toward a post-labor, post-capital, and post-fact world. Free time, leisure, and reality are all up for grabs.
congrats on opening night
Twitter (lately) feels like an interactive police scanner app.
Q3/ When employees start to leave the Ubers, Airbnbs, Slacks etc, where do you anticipate the talent will move and why?
Q2/ What sectors or categories that have been seeded now face a tough funding environment? Which of these hold long-term promise?
Q1/ What VC individuals or funds over $25m+ have taken a strong thematic or vertical approach?

no, i think it's more about how diversified "who is an LP?" is becoming -- not just traditional players anymore.
guessing folks feel their exposure is saturated here, but as points out, overseas LPs may feel the opposite.
yes, i think this is all true, too.
Summary of LP chats from fall:
-expecting $ flow to slow
-LPs eager to diversify away from Valley

beyond 16, ramifications for both parties (donor vs voting bloc) quite profound this time
ya but only helps w/ one piece of the puzzle
I listen to 10+ different political podcasts, but now after 12 hours post-publishing, each episode feels obsolete. Only Twitter can keep up.
maybe. lots of deals can get hot, but even at A and B people don't know BIG something can be.
Obsessed with Ken Bone. He is parlaying this moment w/ remarkable aplomb.
of course. my twitter feed is just for a pretty narrow clientele ;-)
yes, but on a base of at least $50m.
LOL. well-played.
End of day, two ways to build a rep as VC: (1) Take big swings, be selective, go for huge outcome; or (2) be known for returning cash.
who could've imagined Bay Area's abysmal traffic would push society toward not just to Uber, but also to mobility automation!
One thing that does scale in VC is piling $ into winners, but need ample time/room to spend time w/ company to see if it's the right call.
When folks say "VC doesn't scale," it's not just a/b $: it's about time, attention, network, brand, wisdom of small crowds - hard to scale.
Jack Johnson's old tune "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle" turned out just to be a song about VC fund management.
Nothing more Bay Area than seeing a couple of 5-0's drinking pour-over coffee outside a Philz, dunking gluten-free donuts from Pepples.
*could* change a bit (maybe) as some of the valley funds have scaled size to $1Bn+ north &amp; need to bearhug the winners.

2/ LPs hunting for next VC class, doing more direct/hybrid funds, tired of years of VC "games," leaving their institutions
1/ could be VC saturation, or end of cycle, or fatigue (it's hard), or diminishing returns on time for VCs, lack of originality
I find them all now via Twitter, but the best OG archive is by on his site
It may be that more LPs are blogging now than VCs at larger funds. Regardless, VC blogging (excluding the stalwarts) seems to ending.
The last 5 wires from Haystack have been routed to LA, NYC, Boston, Dallas, and Indianapolis.
VC cocktail chatter:

Me: "I don't understand how teams form in Bay Area right now -- lotsa fragmentation."

@Salil: "It's surge pricing."
not generous, just a normal human - was my pleasure!
that's b/c most of them getting so big, $ deployed are often post product-market fit
ya this is why I qualified as saying for the "larger" VC funds
SF Giants blowing a 3-run lead in 9th home in the playoffs in an even year is one of the worst local Bay Area omens of the current boom.

Bill Campbell worked with KP in/out for many years
it's why I bound it to larger VC funds which will need to hold co's longer now.
the right coach would by nature not allow such a transgression
yes but I think having one as the partner could be (theoretically) competitive advantage
LPs want the fees smartly "applied"
oh interesting - need to learn more
bar has to be Bill Campbell-high
they should but they can't
yes at the approval of CEO, a service offered but not req'd
nah, not sure these coaches (if they're good) will care about anything else than helping the CEO
I wouldn't be surprised if larger VC funds, after adding 2-4 operating partners, bring executive coaches in-house as a CEO service, too.
single GP is a religious issue for many. it makes sense. but many assume partnerships stronger than they really are.
yes
not to condone it, but i'd guess usually originates from an older VC/LP who has seen cycles &amp; draws inferences.
well, that's just fucking stupid.
"bandwidth" is a big thing they worry about, even if they don't say it w/ words.

yep. most either don't have the time (hot deal), or know already what they need/want. it's an interesting contrast from LP to GP
meaning, LPs diligence of seed funds is 1000x deeper than what seed GPs put founders through re: DD.

wrong is in eye of the beholder
one local issue to bay area is cost of living is so high, VCs want founders to take a little to buy house, etc.
Recently seen 3-4 newer VC funds focused entirely on auto or mobility, how do people/goods get from A to B w/ incumbents creating action.

Twitter is like Uber for explanations for edge cases.
takes real work + relationships to get $ out of company (secondary, special situation, drive M&amp;A etc.)
yes. well-stated.
could be any kind of liquidity, defined by when all shareholders don't have equal opportunity to liquidate
it's getting real up in here!
these are later stage tho, w/ capital acceleration in last 2 years. medicine will take a while to trickle down.
they were saying only path to this type of return is massive enterprise-value transfer from incumbents via M&amp;A. but wow, huge #s.
Haven't heard this line before, from an LP: "It's easy to find a GP to get into a deal; I'm focused on finding GPs who know how to get out."
he wasn't saying that, just pointing out that it changes the culture, some ways more fair, some ways less desirable.
"Asynchronous Liquidity" = when various shareholders in startup (founders, employees, GPs, angels, etc.) get liquid not at same time.
Ok, folks confused by previous tweet: When shareholders liquidate diff times (cashing out, secondaries etc), incentives &amp; culture changes.
if founders can cash out before GPs, or seed folks before employees etc etc -- changes culture of shared risk/reward.
e.g. if founders (partially) cash out before staff, or before GPs on BoD, etc; potential to misalign risk/reward calc &amp; behavior.
Powerful insight by longtime LP: Asynchronous liquidity, whether moral or not, has fundamentally changed the culture of Bay Area ecosystem.
Wow, OH LP on panel: 640 co's in my database raised $100M+ w/ 50% of $ invested 2015-16 = $200B+ invested, no way IPOs/M&amp;As will cover this.
3/ other ways to mitigate these risks (i) geography (invest outside Valley) and/or (ii) sectors which are contrarian (e.g. e-commerce)
2/ ergo, from VC POV, risks diffused by finding founding teams who can mitigate each -- can recruit on their own, attract $, take lead VCs.
Startup ecosystem in middle of mass-fragmentation -- Fragmentation of talent, of capital, of ownership -- so perhaps, returns as well?biggest sin for GOP this cycle is handling monsters it created; biggest sin for DEM is not fielding deep bench.
not necessarily. this may be a blip on the radar or a coming class/political shift.
loved it. Netflix Mitt should‚Äôve been the candidate, but I think it was the right decision overall to give BHO 2nd term
My new favorite GIF. https://t.co/TsY3EzNCtL
consider uber &amp; FB - even at Series B, it was unclear how real or big they would become
not a bad idea early for both sides, or at least as part of calculus. inherent advantage of accelerators as culture is to ‚Äúapply‚Äù
good point but too early to know still; savvy LP will know enough to isolate ‚Äúwhat‚Äù VC-GP led the deal
the underlying co‚Äôs at seed, upon close examination, often don‚Äôt have much to show or report on for many months
2/ ‚Äú3rd rail‚Äù follow-on rate to top Series A firms b/c larger funds move so rarely &amp; VC overall efficient flytrap
1/ analyzing co-invest is proxy for network &amp; warning LP of potential overlap in portfolio‚Ä¶
this is definitely a ‚Äúthird rail‚Äù of microVC :-)
more often it‚Äôs that founders are too deep into their own stuff to create the deck entirely on their own. systemic.
ya I was gonna make a public list of 5-10 for tmr and share.

RIP Arnold Palmer, great drink &amp; epic ESPN commercial https://t.co/xiYaecj0kU
great idea, thx kirby.
would be funny if they spliced that reel and showed him on a mini-golf course.
hmm, but could also say a good deal of people may not even tune in until well after labor day.
in 2012, it felt very important to the election.
sure, there are optics, but in the pure sense of the term, early VCs can be severely impacted in a restructured round.
can't prove it, i think it's more pronounced now b/c media used to be arbiter, and now candidates can get messages out directly
perhaps caveat could be extra round terms, provisions, ratchets etc which make round appear to be up when it's not.
boots on ground in battleground states, register voters, find believers, have a ground-plan for Nov 8th starting at midnight
Perhaps obvious, but worth pointing out: The media and pundits care more about fact-checking than the electorate does.
ooh, i have yet to see said basement, this is perfect &amp; exactly how i would've pictured it for paul.
could be that the designer is good enough to draw out this story for the founders and empower them
yes, and this is what a great designer should do. more journalism than art.

Tweets about Snap from last night all the way through today are fantastic, creative, funny, futuristic.
Downtown Mountain View is half Hipster, half pan-Asian in every way - food, culture, locals. Very cool to see melding of many diff peeps.
Did Snap just pull an Alphabet? https://t.co/gWaZJGVL9g
Just realized w/ Apple Pay, Snap can push glasses on mobile users (like Amazon pushes Echo to customers) &amp; trigger purchase w/ fingerprint.
also works.

Snap + Warby?
we get a sitter on sunday &amp; i try to get up early and work all day in my office.
adding a sprinkle of chaos to the creative (weekend) process ;-)
wow
great point. yes.
yes, so many angles - to keep fans engaged, investors interested, employees morale high, etc.
kids are an interesting variable to this "flow"
Next question: Will Snap allow others to write apps on their glasses?
As both companies march to IPO, Uber (autonomy) and Snapchat (AR) also now weave in an important bit of future tech waves in their stories.
partly why I tend to push it off
Sign of the times: Today M&amp;A rumors swirl around Twitter while Snapchat artfully leaks their own branded glasses on a lazy Friday afternoon.

if journalists can be good investors, and design work has journalistic quality, then designers can be investors!
all good. you helped kick me in the rear!
depends but generally no
ooo, you makin' me sweat
possibly though if i wasn't lucky to meet this guy, maybe i would've fallen into the same trap!
that's what i'm learning.
quotes for a good person generally $100/hr +/-
what is important? to whom? why? what's different about X, Y, and Z? Can i talk to those sources?
for some, i think the process can be crippling.
so design is more journalism than visual aesthetic?
it may adopted faster in different cities around the world. i don't think consumers expect it here tomorrow, but is moving fast.
What struck me most a/b the designer - the visual design is good, not earth-shattering - it's the questions he asked upfront that were key.
yeah, good idea. stay tuned (for a few months) -- haha!
there are many good shops, but main learning is most teams get derailed by "building the deck" process. too close to their own poop.
re: Slide Decks, I've found two agencies where I've arranged for a "Haystack price" for all my companies - will no longer tolerate B+ decks.
he asked questions up front w/ proper context &amp; asked for intros to interview others to get 360 picture. worth every penny.
wut? this is now circus-level. will be extra good TV, too.
After finding a thoughtful designer to create a slide deck for me, I'm thinking 1/ I'll never do it myself again &amp; 2/ what took me so long?
yes, could be an outlier there. yes.
excellent run-in thx to

re: Twitter M&amp;A tweet, interesting responses. Yes, agree other media conglomerates (or Disney) can play, but No, don't think a fit for $FB.
Twitter only makes sense for these acquirers:
-Google (obvs)
-Comcast, Verizon, etc (discovery network on top of pipes)
-IAC (media rollup)
Uber, but for getting to the point!
thx nick!
good point. my POV is everything will happen in places like Singapore first, then spread.
yeah i think it's rational human nature for many to wait a bit &amp; see
in 5 yrs we will order transport from Uber, or Lyft, or Didi, or in Google/Apple Maps, or voice/wearable
for sport!
written w/ real grace
yes, to fleet managers -- who will lease and charge service on top.
great question, been thinking on it -- don't know yet. but the right question to ask.
partly, but also access to consumer mindshare, which is not trivial.
I think ODE was a feature of mobile. cameras/GPS + messaging defined mobile. (most ODE is actually "scheduled")
For even just 11 auto manufacturers in US, Europe, Japan - represents a roughly $650B combined market cap: https://t.co/iDZhw6rofP
IMO depends on (1) "where" you order transport from (app, map, beacon, etc.) &amp; (2) diff vehicles = diff experiences
ha. objects in mirror are -- indeed -- closer than they appear (good to see you a few weeks back btw)
Facebook defined its age (social) + caught next wave (mobile). Uber defined its age (mobile) + now riding next wave (autonomy).

Betting Against the American Dream (in San Francisco) https://t.co/9VxEOYICqG by
It was a no-brainer to back a founder like Joe: https://t.co/axuYwKhpj0
Wells Fargo creating accounts to rake fees. Facebook overstating video viewing time. Making fake mayo &amp; using VC money to buy that mayo!
key variable is "access" -- every investor, even pro VCs, should ask: "Why am I so lucky to see this deal?"
trying to pitch for an investment but getting a big acquisition offer instead.
Learned by watching a relentless founder: Always pitch hard w/ a concise, crisp message - people notice &amp; unforeseen opportunities emerge.
One of the most depressing realities (one of many) of Election 2016 is that the entire tone of politics could get even worse after Nov 8th.

i said overused, not overrated.
Drinks convo tonight evoked Ex: "George accidentally publishes a revealing photo in his Snapchat Story; Kramer sues Uber."
yes. it's another way of saying network. if done well, totally agree. most think they have it, but they don't.
One of the most overused words in startup-land: "Community"

Lefsetz comparing Trump's use of social media to Drake's experimentation w/ mix tapes: https://t.co/P164aZsYOo
lots of $ out there. sometimes it works as a discount to the next priced round. often not, tho.
yes. also happens to those co's later i.e. raising $3-4m at $30-40m convertible notes from non-VC investors.
one would think!
usually the founder side.
any posts you particularly like that you can cite?
as in the "how to" ID &amp; network into a new sector?
most of that (if i take that approach) would be re: me cutting in -- but not sure larger audience is interested in that
lots of flattish rounds happening in '16 &amp; still good deals for founders, just anchored around previous price.
jacqueline bisset is a fair trade offSteve McQueen may be the only person in the world who could never take Uber and still be cool.

no, can be done, but most seem to "discover" it vs going directly into it.
yes, perhaps this particular risk isn't factored into early rounds &amp; why better to wait w/ scale $
i wish it did -- maybe i could've invested then ;-) congrats again.
2/ uncapped notes which don't convert often a wash "if" company is sold; if a priced round in future, discount applied
1/ a RHC is when instead of raising a priced round w/ $5m into the company, CEO instead raises on notes.
no, b/c often other side doesn't want to hear it.
for sure, perhaps even more brutal who get that wrong but concept right.
ha big market in &amp; of itself
her interviews are awesome &amp; inspiring.
Brutal reality of entrepreneurship: One can work hard, do all the right things, attract best ppl &amp; money -- but not find the right market.
doesn‚Äôt that topic feel over-covered?
don‚Äôt read into too much
LOL. wake up early, 2 bottles, 2 diapers, cut b'fast/lunch, shower+shave all by 730am -- YMMV
indeed. impressive. check this out - i had just started investing, a bit too early ;-) https://t.co/1l4KYlbgaW
Q: If I were to start a contributed column on VC in a known magazine, what topics below are interesting? Or, others?
this always happens after the initial investors invest -- if they knew future at time=0, they'd never invest!
4/ Reason downstream VCs won't touch is more psychological vs price-driven: They don't want to start relationship on down-round note.
3/ Reason most investors in RHCs disengage is no one wants to have hard conversation re: price &amp; endgame. Easier for syndicate to write off.
2/ Additionally in these reckless high cap rounds (RHCs?), most earliest investors &amp; even VCs almost entirely discount startup. Can't help.
in small handful of startups I've seen recklessly raise $ at very high caps instead of facing scrutiny of priced round, CEOs now handcuffed.
you sound like a VC

total guess, but i'd imagine it's currently lower than we think today but could increase rapidly over next decade.
why i've always thought a telco (verizon, comcast, etc.) should buy Twitter
wish i were in that one. am in loomia. and ntopology.
that was the absolute *key* advice i got from a very successful VC - increase surface area early to have a shot.
i'm early here but many have remarked to me how critical "finding luck early" is b/c folks will always question acumen
i'll start compiling a list. i'm sure at least 20.
has to be at least 10-20 right?
ouch
i have a feeling we would be friends.

Best line by marketplace CEO this week:
CEO: "We're doing $5m/month."
Me: "Wow! What's the rake?"
CEO: "Rake? That's net. GMV is horseshit."
oh yeah, deep down!
sorry 'bout that.
It's OK at seed, but don't use the term "LOI" with a big VC.
Actual CEO bio: "___ is passionate a/b artificial intelligence &amp; wants to change the world with it. You talk to him &amp; you'll feel it."
Sometimes I look at startup or investor websites and ask myself "Is this copy real, or is this created by the staff of HBO Silicon Valley?"
End of morality &amp; veracity. Trump can say anything, change his mind, gloss over the truth -- it doesn't matter. All reality now distorted.
true. Mike has been so incredibly helpful to me.
9/11/16 Meet The Press transcript, still thinking a/b this line from David Brooks re: political realignment: https://t.co/oHBsdJB0nR
8/ Very few Series As have true momentum. Tough for CEOs b/c takes so much work to get there, brutal on VC b/c it's a commitment on faith.
opportunity is one thing, an open market for VC investments is another.
7/ Once seed market digests this, expect more push back on terms (next 2 yrs) to make seed model work. Best seed firms doing this from Day 1
6/ This means raising seed (w/ bridge) to get to A means caps over $10M screw up model for earliest investors &amp; most VCs won't take pro-rata
5/ Informal poll of VCs for $5M Series A for a non-momentum deal, they'll want to own 20-25%, so valuation $20-25M post. Momentum bid up.
4/ from VC side, if CEO gets bad rap from initial pitch mtgs, VCs talk &amp; won't even take a mtg a year later. More CEO scrutiny given climate
right. probably, though spreading out risk gives more shots on goals for a Syndicate to be in 1 or more 1000x opps (potentially)
3/ Most-active hot markets open right now: e-commerce (consolidation) &amp; auto (reinvention); latter w/ trillion-$ parts/supplies up for grabs
2/ Investing in "frontier" categories = response to narrowing consumer opportunity right now. Expect more strategics to get on cap table.
Some quick takeaways from Alpha Summit before I head north from Monterrey.

1/ Drone market waiting for M&amp;A action. Few Series Bs.
I could be in that photo.
trad VC model in seed has concentrated risk at the point where it should be syndicated. only a select few can concentrate well.

Most jaw-dropping moment of Alpha so far for me: Unassuming guy in autonomy discussion intro‚Äôd himself as: ‚ÄúHi, I co-founded GoogleX.‚Äù o_O

Ah, interesting. I guess the counter is, if enough defect or rise up in a new location, they could be hired by the next startup
oh? i don't recall. before my time. would love to hear/read your POV on that time re: this.
like i said *earlier*, it could be that OR other factors like recruiting wars, new competition funded, etc.
they move to iceland?
sure, that is just one of many reasons i could cite, but cost of living also impacts risks one can take.
ha -- totally!
loyalty is one of the rarest earth elements in the startup world.
interesting, how so? meaning, they hit Series A &amp; then think about labor cost-reduction strategies?
Yes. I don't understand how startups in SF retain talent given recruitment wars, constant events, Goog/FB salaries. https://t.co/IIBJAn8ZfQ
could be Pitt, or Minneapolis, or Portland, or Philippines, etc.
Meeting more &amp; more Series A founders (or soon to be A) who have 80%+ eng team outside the Valley. Bay Area cost inflation kills runway.
i have one like this who is a beast at sharing the flow now, even after i couldn't join him. Not a usual occurrence.
Founder who scored top tier Series A shared 2 nuggets: 1/ Other only prioritized full partner mtg after top tier partner meeting confirmed.
2/ Average start-time for pitch meeting was appx 10-15 late... at the VC offices! C'mon son!
If someone passes the 1st time but wants to see a subsequent round or raise, it pays to pass politely. An impolite pass is not forgotten.
