Thanks for your support of my blog.
My apologies - it stands for Discounted Cash Flow, where future cash flows are discounted.
4/ I also recommnd early stage startups watch churn like a hawk - it is one of the best indicators of bad product/market fit
3/ whereas churn would tell you the truth about whether customers were actually going to use, and keep using your product

1/ All your other thoughts make sense, but I believe that customer churn is a much more accurate predictor of lifetime
thanks for the feedback. Delighted to have caught you at the right time!

If you haven't already done so, watch Apple's keynote for their WWDC. It's two hours long, but full of very cool innovations.
