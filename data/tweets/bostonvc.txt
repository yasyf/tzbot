3. A high discount rate means years 4,5,6,7,8 values are almost irrelevant in the calc, which is what you're looking for.
2.  But still think churn plus a discount rate get you the right answer. A high discount rate ...

Thanks for your support of my blog.
My apologies - it stands for Discounted Cash Flow, where future cash flows are discounted.
4/ I also recommnd early stage startups watch churn like a hawk - it is one of the best indicators of bad product/market fit
3/ whereas churn would tell you the truth about whether customers were actually going to use, and keep using your product
2/ you could have a terrible product that no one will keep using, and this particular lifetime estimator would be way off.
1/ All your other thoughts make sense, but I believe that customer churn is a much more accurate predictor of lifetime
thanks for the feedback. Delighted to have caught you at the right time!

 You have a world of excitement awaiting you if you switch. And if you still like a few Windows apps, run VMWare.
Impressive that Apple will offer 5GB of iCloud storage for free, including your Photostream on top of that.
If you haven't already done so, watch Apple's keynote for their WWDC. It's two hours long, but full of very cool innovations.
