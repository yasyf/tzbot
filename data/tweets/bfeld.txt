Pitch. Slide. Balk and Bunt.

what's the story with that rain stuff?
kind of like hunger games ...

yeah - not dull. good think i have scotch.
if they tie, what happens? do they play an eighth game?
unreal

love it. this game is going down well with lagavulin 16
the cubs have this solo home run thing down. imagine if they could get runners on base before they hit the homer?
nah - that's easy. fastball to the face is tougher.
tell me when you have chewed up to your elbows ...
hey wtf are you doing in the cubs bullpen? I thought you were a cleveland fan…
hey how’s it going? tough inning?
that’s pretty much the only reason i’m watching this. i grew up with the texas rangers … our best player was our catcher (sundberg)
and - well - it’s game 7…
shall i talk trash to you now …
i definitely have days that feel like i get continuous wild pitches that hit me in the face
it is not for you to understand. it is a mystery.
