Sending someone companies, letting them see what they like, then going deep, debating, chatting. That would be better.
Agreed. REAL relationships. 30 minutes/month going through companies isn't how I'd classify building a real relationship
Do people not take notes on "deal flow" calls?
This is best point but if you trust someone, you shouldn't worry about getting fucked. VC is a small world.
What are you worried about if you're sending the names and descriptions of companies to someone you trust?
 I get it, but VCs always complain about lack of time, and then spend 8x30min meetings on "deal flow" calls per month.
And counterpoint is sure, build REAL relationships, then sharing transactionally is rooted in a personal friendship.
Kidding themselves if they think people don't view them as transactional because they're on the phone asking for deals.
People do monthly calls, dinners, events, FB messages, etc. but nobody wants to just send a spreadsheet or use a database.
The lengths that VCs go to in order to share deal flow, while also actively not codifying or making sharing scaleable continues to baffle me

Mobile is a gateway drug. VR has lots of bad content, but apps to surface great content are coming, which lowers churn.

Don't mean to troll you but it's easy to be pessimistic about VR staying power today when the future is so unwritten.
After that, less certain tbh but lasting power could come from social + new level of entertainment on consumer side.

Basically what I'm saying is good VCs should use CBI, but our data driven bubble is a little insular at times.
Agreed but you get my point. Counter argument is democratization of VC...which is probably BS.
Again, I personally believe VC is in a time of flux but it's not supportable by immediate data, only anecdotes.
It's more rational to bet what made these firms great before "data driven VC" is what keeps them great in last 5 years.
Because founding dates
Bessemer - 1911
Greylock - 1965
Sequoia - 1972
KPCB - 1972
NEA - 1977
Accel - 1983
Battery - 1983
Definitely same winners keep winning (+ a few new each year) which would beg the question of correlation vs causation.

Overall believe data driven is table stakes at early-mid stage but just saying it's not as crystal clear as we all hope.
and 2) have heard how hard to get partners to adopt new data driven tools due to ideas on own network strength/brain.
Yes, TODAY they do but 1) past elite VCs are mostly today's elite VCs which shows data might not be key edge.
Playing devil's  advocate here but there's also no evidence that being more "data driven" = results

You use SLAM + on-board compute to localize and drive disconnected, autonomously. When entering a city can receive packet.
That is entire reason onboard compute and small packet V2V will exist, to remove need to offload data that size in real-time
With each car generating 4TB/day of data, no network will be able to handle that traffic, especially not at city density.
Fair but many companies going after persistent internet + SpaceX delays + all signs point to on-board compute for AVs.

Ok, west coast twitter. Your turn to tweet about Otto and Uber.
I.e. If a car crashes, you don't know exactly what went wrong, just that it most likely won't happen again for exact reason.
No, the point being the entire concept of a neural net being a black box is a scary one for consumers and autonomous vehicles.
Comma, gathering data &amp; could be rolled into driverless system. Debatable if Neural nets are viable for consumer AVs though.

Think more AV teams are going to think about this trade-off. Long-term building v. selling then running it back after lock up.
Only debate here is would you rather have $1B+ in cash from a scared incumbent or ~$680M in shares from innovative newcomer.
Trust me, they were building something great. Outcome was massive, team was massively talented.
Implying that AV is an overheated, fear-driven M&amp;A market right now?
Bootstrapped company, building for &lt;2 years, sells for ~$680M + 20% profit upside on core business. What an outcome.
No I'm saying level 4, full autonomy where drivers can not watch the road, will at least be *on the road*. Not mainstream.
In terms of Level 4 autonomy being mainstream? Hard to say. But the first passenger vehicles will be in next 4-5 years IMO.

Yeah but I want hardware specifics and standard deviation from specified ship date.

Disagree. Robots are made to perform more efficiently than their creator's. Why new types of "arms" are being made.
This is basically the argument against humanoid robots too. Often the optimal form factor will be unintuitive initially.

Point being, that could be an industry problem with risk-taking. Don't think VR will be dominated by non-risk taking incumbents.

the issue is consistently perfect latency. If an 18-wheeler "lags" IRL downtown you've got problems.
teams have had issues with latency in terms of remote drive by wire thus far. That is a solution though.
incredibly difficult problem to solve first and last 10% of journey though. Fastest go to market would  be to augment with drivers.

it's an art not science. If I had to quantify: Think about value of tech 8-10 years from now and if it starts diminishing 4-6.
with that said, I'm still looking for a high altitude long endurance drone play where 1 drone provides entire city data feed.
At current rate of innovation, onboard autonomy will be fine + solo drones in cities,where autonomy is most difficult won't work.
Well I finally found a time to try - a bit of a disaster but that's what being a beginner is per my dude Andy.

I think you're marginalizing how much of a shift would be needed for what you're talking about, but ok.
Infrastructure meaning a fundamental physical shift in a city's makeup. (i.e. new lanes, new tracks, moving existing structure).
If the above ground pods don't require infrastructure, they are just a autonomous vehicle on a circuit, which exists now.
issue is now you're expecting city governments to build budget for massive infrastructure overhaul for tech that doesn't exist
This is a larger discussion than twitter allows, but lack of effort shown by this (vs. asking a founder for a PDF) is insane.
Right, underground transport of 200 people from brooklyn to USQ will != AVs. But marginal cost v. utility ratio will fall
Efficiency. Lower cost. I mean there are very few constraints for AVs vs. trains which are all about defined paths.

Agreed. Hence the long Leo Health statement.
All I'm saying: If we sell a vision of a co growing to recruit, but won't say $ upside should play a role, don't include in offer
But them + VCs are preaching to employees about equity value equaling 0. Kind of a put up or shut up moment IMO.
If those founders believe that, then don't offer equity. Or don't include in offer so emps make decision without it.
People are trying to say assume they're worth 0, but yet we sell a vision by including them in offer letter as comp.
Buy you're viewing it as something. And thus if you had a bunch of offers, your equity package would matter to you.
Agree, but the narrative was "assume options are worth 0" which is bullshit when you're deciding between 2 startups
Any company where the options have a real tangible value. I.e. Cos where the risk of going to 0 is mostly gone.
Haven't seen many employees say equity doesn't matter.Only VCs + founders. Issue is too complicated to make blanket statements.
If a startup employee is deciding between multiple mid to late-stage startup offers, saying equity doesn't matter at all is idiotic.
Consumerization of healthcare is more speaking to consumer-esque UX a la Leo, One Medical, and others.
Agreed. It's incredible how it only takes 1 well written piece on a given topic to blow up tech twitter.
It's incredible the number of people with "drone enthusiast" in their twitter bio.

5/5 Don't really have answer for this tonight, but think these types of cos (open-ended in mission, consumer focused) are key for adoption.
4/ Don't think this is an issue w/ drones, as wow factor is there, however w/ VR, which has come and gone before, it's less certain.
3/ And if so, does it come down to identifying when the market/tech has developed enough for you to add the most *clear* value?
2/ As a large, public brand with lots of attention, do you only have one shot with consumers on these types of emerging tech?
1/ Thinking about "incumbents" timing emerging categories. Specifically, feels like GoPro is moving too slow in potential VR and drone plays

Nice. Not saying the idea is revolutionary, more speaking to value of consistent, open iteration of thought.
5/ People remember others' personality, thoughts, and actions, and Twitter is the best place to consistently, publicly show these.
4/ If I were really struggling with the personal CRM problem, I just got multiple referrals on who is best to have a conversation with next.
3/ While not all of us have the same sized megaphone, this shows value of openly thinking, iterating, exploring, and pressure testing.
2/ The power of strongly backing and teasing out this concept shows in the number of CCs and DMs I'm sure have been sent his way.

Slightly different model than the "provide back office support" but interesting middleman nonetheless.
Weird signal if multiple fund Partners want to do a deal but fund doesn't IMO.
Remove those factors as well. The fund very clearly invests at the stage + is sector agnostic. Deal size == allocation availability
When Partners of a VC fund do a deal, but the actual fund doesn't, what is best reasoning besides fund not being able to get allocation?
https://t.co/3NpAR6qDzB - Adding analytics and lowering barrier for becoming an Uber/Lyft/etc. driver even more.
Disappointment. Companies shouldn't make cool landing pages that reference Frontier Tech and then do on-demand.
