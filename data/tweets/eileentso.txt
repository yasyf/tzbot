massive thanks for all of your efforts/work for UK fintech as EST; was such a privilege to work with you https://t.co/vYhC9v5TGk
absolutely loving all the gifs for #KimExposedTaylorParty
...and wouldn't it have been even better to bring in intl $$ to fund ARM acquisitions and increase UK dominance in that market?
anyone in the world would've funded ARM to make acquisitions/expand strategy, doesn't have to be UK/domestic ¬£ (they never wanted)
as evidenced by the reported sale, capital is avail for valuable assets... more a cultural issue imho #armsoftbank https://t.co/i779cCvV3k
.@nsgcinvest don't agree re mfg'g (imho fabless brilliant, ie 95% margin) but do believe like Intel, ARM should've done brand/consumer mktg
reportedly ARM didn't run an auction process... not sure that's extracting maximum shareholder value
I concur
"... consistent cash-flow and hardware-light business model yields margins north of 95% every quarter since 2014..." https://t.co/WnP5b4jzEP

ah apols, this thread getting hard to track (my bad) :)
nope, I wasn't ;)
I think that's just not true. tech ppl are generally contrarian and v questioning by nature
who'scared? I've had many ppl ask/approach me. not all of us need to be in media in order to have debates
was a question to you. "groupthink" implies ppl are not thinking for themselves and I genuinely don't believe that's the case
I've had many debates perhaps not "in the scene" but def offline/ f2f and made myself v avail to do more
or perhaps for logical, analytical ppl used to problem solving, innovating and getting sh*t done there's only one obvs choice?

.@mikekelly85 for me distinction important b/c challengers/neobanks will be of much more value (back-end/core), others just apps/front-end
I heard from drivers that's only w/a specific configuration, requires specific phone or similar (??) def not universally avail
imho  = neobanks (are seeking/have secured bank licenses)
wrt last tweet (neobanks and the rest), 2 add'l pts: 1. true challengers (value) will be licensed/regulated; 2. wirecard is freaking winning
imho there are true "neobanks" (challenger banks) and then the rest are all simply apps on top of/for pre-paid cards https://t.co/uUbXnLWls9

go make it 10000 :) jokes aside, nice work!
:( hope you're feeling better soon!
I don't either, but yes I have (really)
yay... ;)
dude, either way you ought to vote
think it is time (after 4h, ouch)... to... slowly... step... away
lol glad to be of service, but unfortunately it destroyed my plans to get through any work here in the office!
appreciate that, Mic
wow, feels like I stepped into some crazy space-portal (can I just go back to RT'ing about scented candles and Drake pls?!) ;)
and yet they've raised $210 million, with most recent round just being 5 months ago... (things that make you go hmmm)
noted w/thanks. hope they'll email to further enlighten (eileenburbidge at gmail) cc
apology accepted. look forward to your keystrokes (email if you have time so I can learn more)
pleasure to meet you. can you drop me email eileenburbidge at gmail dot com so I can learn more pls?
thank you (and also for so earnestly and genuinely engaging with the tech community)
I love Twitter too! Elected official quotes my tweet using quote function and yet mis-quotes it at the same time https://t.co/hPbSkuVpPP
thank you, Alastair
whichever makes you feel better. I'm asking for information now instead of just spouting off
no one's assuming anything, and I am asking (email, more info, points of view, etc) + listening
y, hence my asking you to help inform me. I stated that no one I spoke to wanted brexit
can you expand on that "treatment" in email pls eileenburbidge at gmail dot com /cc
indeed and thankfully, that's the way democracy works. hope to hear more via email
ok Gifted Nutter, email me; I'd love to hear more pls eileenburbidge at gmail /cc
also, if you have time to drop me an email I'd love to learn/hear more eileenburbidge at gmail dot com
thanks, get in touch with as they've been searching for people to discuss on record
again, all relative and depends on measure, but some would say I know a fair # (ps would like to hear from you)

awesome; thank you. will you also submit text via email to the submission address, pretty please?
.@DouglasCarswell with respect, no one I know in digital/tech wants Britain to leave EU, overwhelmingly in favour of in plus DSM

I loved my Q10 but also carried an iPhone with it (seriously don't need the iPhone anymore with the Priv)
??? why'd you do that??? buy another one, you won't regret it
the Priv is amazing (seriously). took me a while to get used to Android (meh) but the Priv is awesome and I love it
the BB or # emails? tbh not even sure if #s are atypical or normal (this is first time I've counted). going to pay more attn+see
I do because two of our companies' apps are iOS only atm. but with the new BB Priv I don't need/use my iPhone any other time
19 hours after I sent my first email of the day (Monday), I notice that I sent a total of 118 emails and received 174 = why I still use a BB

I repeat: have a nice day
sure re universities etc, hence my question specifically around individuals and private investors
there is research cited in the podcast (listen to it, only 17 minutes) ;)
what else do you think explains the precipitous drop? (the interviews and examples cited are compelling)
tldr = home/personal PCs were marketed to boys (and mainstream movies eg Weird Science and Revenge of the Nerds)
thanks, that's v kind of you to say
yes, that's what's explored in podcast (adverts/marketing, movies/films etc) https://t.co/OD12Bp5wJu
same here, I'd never seen that graph nor realised the trend reversal
yes, that and Weird Science both cited in the podcast (When Women Stopped Coding [1984]) https://t.co/OD12Bp5wJu https://t.co/619MMjFIWn

broadband = type of Internet access and 5% UK presently without so this is good for them, mobile next (happy Saturday) ;)
yet again who's to say they're not also working on mobile too? you'd rather they don't announce this at all?
erm re-announcing what? afaik current USO only 28.8 Kbps and non-legally binding universal service commitment 2 Mbps https://t.co/8YRot4kBzQ
no indeed but do still want it to have web presence too. USO broadband != not investing also in mobile data
apols still don't follow this train of thought. USO for broadband not mutually excl to faster mobile/data?
2/2 wrt point of mobile device access, that's not directly tied to broadband, depends on mobile operators y?
1/2 I don't have details but seems USO most important for ~5% w/o any access today so is a good step no?

indeed (completely agree based on what I was told wrt warrants) https://t.co/B3A0gTbMfb
agree it to be strange and was told it was inaccurate. imho careless word choices by non-tech spox causes confusion
.@RidT same as what I've been told (no change to status quo re encryption, end-to-end or otherwise) /cc #IPBill
tomorrow at 12:30 GMT
was told all briefings/comms strategy was same: to assert no plans to ban e2e, guess media likes to fuel flames
I have been told (today) there simply is no such clause #IPBill  https://t.co/h9HBKwE0Z2

as follow-up to my last tweet, who's the most highly-regarded tech founder (entrepreneur) in London/UK right now?
