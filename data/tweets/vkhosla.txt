Neither is universally true. Both partly true. All kinds of people in all areas. And billions  have no access to doctors/care
Exactly why we need to make "the consumer CEO of his own health". Fewer extra surgeries, procedures becasuse they make money
Technology is a tool (like nuclear). we can use it well or poorly. Up to us to develop, use, train it well.
Agree this and lots more to worry about - quality + overdependence early, self diagnosis....How to train doctors to this new method?
Agree. Not clear how to not let lower cost technology be "value priced" high. Welldoc mobile app software "drug" is $180/month
Let's use doctors for what humans do well. Let's reduce the knowledge &amp; training to be a doctor so we train 10X more doctors
Most patients don't get this love today in most of world. US is minutes per visit. In Tanzania 100x more patients per doctors

Agree. I did not say everything will be done by machines. But for this task shouldn't we select doctors for empathy over IQ?
Nurses will be able to do as much or more than today's doctors. They gain a lot &amp; provide more, better, cheaper care
Your generalized conclusion, not mine. My statements are much more nuanced at http://t.co/i7St1YWAak
And are you an expert in machine learning technology evolution over twenty years to judge this? Know what you dont know
how do you know?Plenty would say the opposite. I've not said "no humans" but "different role &amp; fewer humans"
