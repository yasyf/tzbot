At 3% income growth for 50yrs $50k income in real dollars will increase to $250k. We still need minimum wage workers?

What if an AI system driven robot was the cheapest machinist and best artisian &amp; most creative to boost?
Agree straight forward income redistribution not optimal &amp; incentives should remain. Negative income taxes better?
If AI scenario happens we'll have abundant GDP to take care of everyone but great disparity. Only people who want to work may need to work.
In the past each new technology leveraged humans. Maybe not so with AI except in a small % of cases like research? Creativity maybe?
Proof can only happen in 50yrs. But first principles argue that for first time there are few human skills in production to leverage

Any thoughtful person is, VC or not. But clickbait revenue incentive drives journalists more &amp; more to unethical headline grabbers
I'd agree on the 30/70 ratio there too! I love people who stand up for principles &amp; aren't embararsed by press
I'm glad #theil has ability to respond and willing to stand up for it. press gets very uppity when challenged
Maybe 30% of journalists have principles. 70% trying to make a buck, get clicks, truth/fiction/msidirection ok
"Billionaires" has nothing to do with it. Principles do.

Love to see general accounting of terrorist attacks prevented by surveillance. Need cost/benefit clarity &amp; curve of tradeoffs + transparency
The constitution has done great &amp; mostly stood test of time; "bear arms" clause (eg) needs updating as protection needs changed
Agree we need to be thoughtful on these very good questions. And Transparency from govt agencies
Anyone can call anyone names in lieu of thoughtful debate you idiot, moron, dumbass,... need better dialog
Or create Trump type hysteria as alternative. We need balance of principals &amp; pragmatism to make society work. Transparency is key
Intent of basic income? Yes!! Specifics like basic income or negative income tax? Needs discussion. https://t.co/1byzCbsjVG
Protecting principals &amp; pragmatism balance. Make society work. You're too quick to assume ulterior motive
Agree! But Cruz gets his votes anyway. When a segment has little to lose they take any outlandish/bet/belief!
Only one segment that is disenfranchised. Needs short (pacthes) &amp; long term (causal issues) solutions
Good question that needs thoughtful balance. NSA went too far. Apple is too far. Disclosure/scrutiny/openess of rules is key
Big difference between a highly likely terrorist's privacy vs casual spying  on ordinary people. Need balance &amp; thoughtfulness

obviously you have little critical understanding if that is how you interpreted what I said
moronish and wrong interpretation of what i said. That's why we need a better education curriculum
it is not an argument for STEM that I made! I made an argument for thinking skills and forming a base for learning
another silly interpretation of what I said
yes it would need the right kind of tools, not today's easy course kind of liberal arts
I don't. If you had had a decent education you'd understand what I said

u did not say "cite". I said "understand " the diverse topics Economist covers from arts/culture/business/politics/Geo/tech/Econ

I did not. I said something different but people like you who didn't understand make me sad. Seems like wasted education in my view
I agree with . Finished by saying I'd like ideas but most responses either didn't read fully or sadly didn't understand
too bad. Hoping to save new students from ed many  got &amp; paid a lot for. Could have done much better &amp; not do a professional degree
intelligent response
and I feel sorry for you. What does that achieve? Sadly, most responses fail to understand what I said.
great. Let's find time and place
obviously you didn't read essay as I argued for many liberal arts subjects as good graduate degree subjects
I argued not against intent of liberal arts major but it's implementation as incomplete paths and easy paths to graduation
obviously event doesn't know how to read. Idiotic response that misses the point of intelligent citizenry skills

As I state in my paper on healthcare at  http://t.co/yEvq80pxDd these are not absolutes but “likely to be more-true-than-not” speculations
DR needs it. Already drug interaction too complex for most doctors (except common cases). Machines do better &amp; most doctors agree
This is the task ahead of us for next decade or two. We are far from doing it today
We have an opportunity to segment patients, &amp; personalize treatment, based on phenotypic assessments. Who's doing the best work?
PCP doctor spends 13-16 min per visit http://t.co/pgK4oV6UyV &amp;  wait time to see doctor is 18 days http://t.co/nmvh1QpLHa
Not enough resources to make it happen in most of the world. Maybe if it took 2-3 years to train a "doctor" it might work.
Scary where technology may lead. way fewer middle class and all class jobs. will need to fundamentally readdress
Neither is universally true. Both partly true. All kinds of people in all areas. And billions  have no access to doctors/care
Exactly why we need to make "the consumer CEO of his own health". Fewer extra surgeries, procedures becasuse they make money
Technology is a tool (like nuclear). we can use it well or poorly. Up to us to develop, use, train it well.
Agree this and lots more to worry about - quality + overdependence early, self diagnosis....How to train doctors to this new method?
Agree. Not clear how to not let lower cost technology be "value priced" high. Welldoc mobile app software "drug" is $180/month
Let's use doctors for what humans do well. Let's reduce the knowledge &amp; training to be a doctor so we train 10X more doctors
Most patients don't get this love today in most of world. US is minutes per visit. In Tanzania 100x more patients per doctors
I fully agree that this "act of love" will remain a big part of a "doctor's" role and tech will allow more time for it.
But to be fair there will be disadvantages of new system but more advantages than disadvantages is my guess
yes but your child was not monitored by the medical system I envision.
Agree. I cover details at http://t.co/i7St1YWAak . Most, especially press, don't read details of my views before commenting.
Agree. I did not say everything will be done by machines. But for this task shouldn't we select doctors for empathy over IQ?
Nurses will be able to do as much or more than today's doctors. They gain a lot &amp; provide more, better, cheaper care
Your generalized conclusion, not mine. My statements are much more nuanced at http://t.co/i7St1YWAak
And are you an expert in machine learning technology evolution over twenty years to judge this? Know what you dont know
how do you know?Plenty would say the opposite. I've not said "no humans" but "different role &amp; fewer humans"
better read at http://t.co/i7St1YWAak than the press sumamry which is misleading &amp; sensational; truth is much more nuanced
yes it can have more judgement &amp; "instinct"; read original at http://t.co/i7St1YWAak instead of press conclusion!
No I am not. Your wrong conclusion. I judge by patient perception &amp; patient outcome
worse in rest of world except for privileged few! My comments r about average care

Understand humor. Besides "less evolved" does not equal "apes". I dislike unclear thinking. Not believing = less rational to me!

You're entitled  to your opinion as am I. I do believe some opinions (&amp; quality of thinking) are superior &amp; others are inferior
