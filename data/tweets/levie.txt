Consider how America would be responding to refugees if this wasn't an election season. Sad.
We don't have strict gun laws because "criminals would find a way to get guns anyway." But we block refugees because "that will stop ISIS."
The blocking of Syrian refugees in America is so incredibly narrow-minded. ISIS has an infinite set of solutions to this, refugees don't.

The startup advantage is that you can build for a small, but growing market, while big companies wait around till the market is all grown.
Silicon Valley isn't anti-regulation, it's anti-illogical regulation. And unfortunately much of the world is illogically regulated.

Someone at Microsoft officially pressed the "we're not screwing around anymore" button. Quite impressive to watch.
Google now has drones, robots, AI, and self-driving cars. What a different world it would be if Altavista had won the search wars.
Disruption is the art of identifying which parts of the past are no longer relevant to the future, and exploiting that delta at all costs.
If any startup needs a security analyst, apparently my mom is available. http://t.co/JoDXhSwcBt
Box couldn't exist without open source projects. We're announcing Box Open Source to now give back our own. http://t.co/n2qp8WXMcN
If every customer is using your product "correctly", you'll never learn anything interesting about what to do next.
UberRush is like when Amazon first revealed it was no longer *just* a bookstore. Now comes a steady march toward global domination.
The good news and the bad news about HBO's Silicon Valley:
Good news: It's accurate.
Bad news: It's accurate.
If HBO got their portrayal of Silicon Valley right, the show will be exactly like Entourage, minus every fun thing they do in Entourage.
Bush: "What should my post-presidency legacy be?"
Advisor: "Bill Clinton promotes world peace..."
Bush: "Ok. I think I'll paint faces."
Strange that you can't just cut your way to innovation. http://t.co/tjtQo33A4M
Microsoft offering free Windows on phones and tablets is nontrivial. This is a big move, as it changes their business model entirely.
April Fool's day is now when technology companies announce their most practical products.

Seattle City Council member: "No, I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù kill innovation, but I do want to buy a year for the taxi world to adapt."
Too little process and you can't get good work done. Too much process and you can't get any work done. Most companies never find the middle.
Wow. Seattle. You've lost your mind. This is how you fall behind in innovation. http://t.co/t7lXCRWjDE
We're heading towards the Post-perimeter Enterprise, as work is distributed, global, and mobile. This redefines security, apps, and IT.

Massive enterprise opps:

3. A billion new workers
4. New data sources (drones, satellites)
Software eats the org chart: it used to be that the hierarchy of a company dictated how information was shared, now software does.

So Satoshi Nakamoto, who was outed as *the* Satoshi Nakamoti, now claims he's not *the* Satoshi Nakamoto. Just another day of Bitcoin.
Idea: The next time someone creates a currency and uses their real name as the inventor, let's just believe them.
That awkward moment when your startup doesn't have a drone strategy.
Calls to the authorities must be very confusing right now: "I have cryptocurrency stored in MtGox, can you help me get it back?"

Feature request for Twitter: tell me which tweet kicked off the Marc Andreessen soliloquy so I can read in the proper order.
I don't have time to read about acquisitions that are done for less than $350 million per employee anymore.
New best practice: Get rejected from a job, then sell your company to that same company and become a billionaire.
You either buy your existential threat for the lowest amount they'll sell for, or you don't and find out later if you were wrong.

Zuck is literally the most badass ceo of all time. This guy doesn't screw around with innovators dilemma.
OMG the Internet is so crazy and amazing all at once.
Every top app in the App Store is officially now some variant of Flappy Bird. As such, Box will be rolling out "Tappy Files" shortly.

Everyone who said we'd stop seeing groundbreaking mobile innovation was wrong. You'll soon be able to order Taco Bell on your iPhone.
Chrome OS can now run Windows. Microsoft considering letting Windows run Android apps. If you do both at once, you enter the matrix.
Enterprise software has a big future: In the industrial economy, IT aided competitive advantage. In the information economy, IT defines it.
Hard to believe we're going back to a time before there was Flappy Bird.
In basically every area of our society extortion would lead to jail and fines. If you're a patent troll, it leads to legal millions.

When competitiveness is driven by who has better information, you'll care about a company's data balance sheet as much as its financial one.
Flappy Bird: a game played by the world, on a device designed in America &amp; made in China, by a developer in Vietnam, who now makes $50K/day.
Flappy Bird now makes $50,000 per day. Proving we're all in the wrong business.
Everything changes when we move from an industrial economy to an information economy: http://t.co/Vzng4A5QK1
Ok, it's been 24 hours. Is Microsoft fixed yet?
The only way Microsoft will come back strong is to start playing offensively: make bold moves, invent new categories, and go open.

Innovator's dilemma taught us how simple technologies disrupt the complex; now we're seeing the advanced challenging the basic.
It's a great time to be a startup: the railroads of the 21st century are being built right now, yet most incumbents are selling wagons.
In the industrial economy we valued a company by its physical assets. In the information economy, we'll need to find ways to value its data.

If I've got this right, with Boston Dynamics, Nest, and Deepmind, Google is building a thermostat robot dog that can learn on its own.
The awkward part about acquiring an artificial intelligence company is they already knew it was going to happen.
Most of the tech for every industry to become software-defined hasn't been created yet. This is the big opportunity over next decade.
Enterprise software is a $300B market based on tools built for the industrial era. This number will be dwarfed in the information era.

My understanding is Carl Icahn is getting so into Silicon Valley he's looking for a technical co-founder.
Netflix's evolution: Go from physical product to digital, once digital change the entire product. This will happen in most markets.
As the competitive use of information begins to define every industry, opportunities in enterprise software will grow exponentially.

If you're not starting a software-enabled hardware company right now, you've lost your mind.
It should go without saying that a differentiated Internet will curtail innovation and progress, so like, let's not go that direction.
The future will confuse lots of companies: one day you make home appliances, the next day you're competing against a search engine.
With home automation, self-driving cars, robots, mobile, and life sciences, Google is setting itself up to own the 21st century.
We are entering incredible times: you can now build a $3B+ hardware company in 4 years. Congrats Nest!
And there it is. Google now controls everything.
The big race: can companies outside of software adapt with technology faster than the tech industry can move into their industry.
Industrial Era -&gt; Information Era:

It would not be surprising if the villain in Transformers 5 is an evil teleprompter.
CES: The world's greatest show for vendors to demo what a different set of vendors will successfully commercialize 10 years later.
Zynga now accepting Bitcoins. Which means I've either never understood Zynga's demographic or still don't understand Bitcoin's.
The internet showed its promise in the last few years. In 2014, the divide between tech-disrupted sectors and those unaffected goes away.
When you're an optimist and wrong, at worst you'll look crazy. When you're a pessimist and wrong, at best you'll look myopic.
The worst part about the Stanford game being over is that we're all going to go back to discussing Bitcoin again.
Tech Disruption:
Step 1: Better delivery of an existing service ("Oh neat")
Step 2: Using data to change the service altogether ("Oh shit")
Chromebooks were 21% of commercial laptop sales in 2013. This is a dangerous trend for a company that rhymes with shmicrosoft.
Startups: look for markets with the biggest delta between an incumbent's next *natural* move and what customers want.
UPS and Fedex were late to deliver Christmas presents. Somewhere, an Amazon delivery drone is smiling.
Google has removed New York based RapGenius from many searches. Larry Page also drove by their office after and yelled "west side."
Last century, companies that won had industrial economies of scale. Now, winners will be those with information economies of scale.
2013 was amazing. Amazon showed us Drone delivery, Google is finding ways to live forever, and Snapchat now lets you replay photos.
They're making a TV show about Twitter. I'm assuming it's like Breaking Bad, but with people rebooting servers instead of dealing meth.
Now that attack robots have entered the picture, "Google it" probably won't have the same meaning in 10 years.
Apparently people forget Google's founding mission: Organize the world's information, and have robot dogs patrolling the streets.
"No, no, go ahead and use Bing. It's fine." http://t.co/JNQLDi7wjq
Starting an internet business was so much easier when you didn't have to launch a robot or drone offering to stay competitive.
The easiest software incumbent to disrupt is the one prioritizing the needs of its strategy over the needs of its customer.

"I'm looking for a currency that fluctuates by about 50-95% per day, what would you recommend?" - how most people discover Bitcoin
Bitcoin reached $750 dollars today, up from $400 last week. Or, an increase of 50 beanie babies.
Products evolve based on assumptions that eventually become outdated. This is every incumbent's weakness and startup's opportunity.
We're enamored with the concept that there's "always a price." But sometimes, your goal is to build a great company, not sell it.
No one rational would have turned down $3 billion for SnapChat. But, no one rational would have built SnapChat in the first place.

Incumbents are rarely disrupted by new technologies they can't catch up to, but instead by new business models they can't match.
Enterprise IT is on the brink of major change, moving focus from:

The 80's were the best: http://t.co/WQ7N4RWFbp
How to innovate in the enterprise:
1. Find technology that's out of reach for most businesses
2. Simplify it for the masses
3. Repeat
People laugh about smart watches, but those are probably the same people that said the Zune would never work. Oh wait.
If you haven't shared your opinion on the Yahoo! logo yet, you're not using the internet properly.

The technology industry has more plot twists than an M. Night Shyamalan movie.
Microsoft wants to be Apple + Google. Google wants to be Apple + Microsoft. And Apple just wants to be appreciated.
Paradoxically, technology now supports open/modular architectures, yet the industry is becoming even more vertically integrated.

Once you realize Miley Cyrus was twerking at the VMAs, and *not* VMworld, it gets a lot less interesting.
Just in case you wanted even more opinions on Ballmer's departure and the future of Microsoft: http://t.co/uv7qIUJg1c
Just went outside for 30 minutes and didn't check my phone. So, basically I experienced Burning Man.
Microsoft grew up in an era where for them to win, others had to lose. To succeed going forward, it has to change this mindset.
Perspective: While Ballmer was CEO, Microsoft grew revenue by $55B. Dell grew by $31B, Oracle by $27B, Intel by $19B, IBM by $16B.
Job description for new Microsoft CEO: 
1. Fix mobile problems
2. Fix software problems
3. Read The Innovator's Dilemma
Weird. Can't seem to find this Microsoft job posting anywhere on LinkedIn.
It's easy to assume things can only get better at Microsoft. It's a $78 billion revenue company. They can almost only get worse.

An incumbent will always think a startup's product is just a "feature". But all that matters is what the customer thinks.
We're all on the unending quest to find the space between "The world isn't ready for it yet" and "You're too late."

Snapchat rumored to be raising a round at a nearly $1B valuation. Good to see we're back to *regular* tech news again.

Startups often win because it's easier to see what comes next when you don't have to worry about maintaining what came last.
You don't compete with incumbents playing by the rules they created. You find a game they can't play.
"If you don't have something to say about Game of Thrones, don't say anything at all" - Twitter
The trick is knowing when what comes next should be an iteration of what came last vs. when it should be nothing like before.

Yahoo owned tech news today. That hasn't happened since, like, 1995.
To everyone that thinks Tumblr is going to be overrun with ads: you know how simple the Google homepage is? That was Marissa.
Yahoo's past 5 CEOs are like,"what's a Tumbler?" *This* is why you hire Marissa.
Kids: stay in school. Unless of course you have an idea for a billion dollar micro-blogging service.
YouTube: $1.6B; Instagram: $1B; Tumblr: $1.1B; Gaining relevance and avoiding disruption: Priceless
Questioning Tumblr's longevity is useless. It's like saying Sony shouldn't have made the Walkman because the iPod eventually came.
Dear Teens: when I was your age, we too posted GIFs on the web, using something called Geocities. Owned by Yahoo. Deal with it.
7 years ago Yahoo was going to spend a billion dollars to buy an emerging social platform, and then blew it. Not this time.
History is littered with tech companies that never had a comeback, not with those that did. That's why we're rooting for Yahoo.

Samsung now has 3 CEOs. It's like, damn, hook Groupon up.
You have to hand it to a company that was once probably best known for making refrigerators for dominating the phone market like this.
Shutting down products is the new launching products.
Google just clarified for the Internet what "beta" means.
Google Reader shutting down. Twitter killed the RSS star.
Apparently black smoke from the Groupon HQ also means a CEO has not been selected yet.
You don't know what's possible until you try things that you thought weren't.
The more you take as a given, the less you can change.
"SXSW is lame" - people that wish they were at SXSW.If everything goes according to plan, then your plan was too easy.
I hereby take back every mean thing I've ever said about Bush. http://t.co/vf3eqY0W0B
We've really just been beta testers of the internet for the last 2 decades. The biggest disruptions are yet to come.
The first rule of SXSW is: you always talk about SXSW.
SXSW is just Twitter in real life.
What a coincidence. I was just thinking to myself the other day, Facebook needs to be more like a newspaper.
Market: We think Dell is worth X. Michael Dell: Ok, I will buy Dell for X and then some. Market: Woah, no way, you're worth way more.
Some see a "market leader," others see a slow incumbent holding back a market from its full potential.
Based on the success of Dennis Rodman's diplomacy in North Korea, I hope they're preparing to send Michael Jordan to Iran.
"I have to get my ducks in a row" - one of the few lines shared by businesspeople and duck enthusiasts.
Scale as an advantage erodes as "economies of scale" in computing, labor, or manufacturing can now be rented. This changes everything.
That awkward moment when you're a slow moving incumbent and the rest of the world not only realizes it, but can do something about it.
Often the best work you do you'll be doing for the first time.
Babe Ruth's startup advice: "It's hard to beat a person who never gives up."
We're approaching the end of IT scarcity: instead of getting a little value from a few enterprise vendors, we'll get a lot from many.
Your only job: shrinking the time between "idea" and "reality."
FYI: now would be a bad time to pitch venture capitalists on your daily deals startup.
Dear investors: the next time you think a coupon company should sustain unprecedented growth rates indefinitely, don't.
The story of Groupon shouldn't be about Andrew Mason as a CEO, but the irrationality of markets.
The amount of "unsexy" problems left to be solved far outnumbers the "sexy" problems that have already been solved.
No sense denying the future: http://t.co/qIs4JZnMuF
Phew. Snapchat is finally sued by someone claiming to be a founder. Now they've actually made it.
One company's solved problem is another company's disruption opportunity.
#ifihadglass I'd walk around small towns and ask people what year it is. Then see if they happen to have any spare plutonium.
Breaking: New images of Yahoo HQ: http://t.co/9iIEjP1tH3
Yahoo can't simultaneously dramatically change the direction of where they're going while also doing everything as they have before.
Going to be awkward if we find out Daniel Day-Lewis has been doping this whole time.
Hard to take an award show seriously that didn't have Nicolas Cage nominated for anything.
Who needs to actually go to the Oscars when you can just be totally confused by reading bursts of reactions on Twitter?

Meeting at Google: Person 1: "So, who is left to disrupt?" Person 2: "LensCrafters?"
Google is making laptops. Apple is making watches. I better be able to buy an Oracle phone by the end of the year.
Apple watch is apparently a digital snap bracelet. 10 year old girls are going crazy right now. http://t.co/g2GVSO6N2N
Cloud does to incumbent technology vendors what the MP3 did to the music business. And the responses are almost the same.

In a strange twist, it will probably turn out that only North Korea is prepared to defend against meteor attacks.
Customers have most of the answers, it's just that companies often mess up the questions.
We can only assume Exxon is behind all this Tesla controversy.
Looking forward to the new CBS series, CSI: Tesla
You only get the benefit of a first mover advantage if you continue get farther down the curve faster than everyone else.
If you don't like competition, you're in the wrong business.
It would be hard to argue that America wouldn't be better off if we just did all those things in the next 4 years.
That moment when the competition executes your 2008 roadmap.
Unfortunate to see North Korea wasting so much energy on nukes, when they could just be making really great Android tablets instead.
Startups = (Chaos) x (Ambiguity)
Microsoft is setup for a massive comeback once the 80-inch computer market takes off. http://t.co/zWt5jz3g
So the Pope has resigned. Activist shareholders sure are getting more aggressive these days.
Any product that isn't evolving in fundamental ways at a rate faster than Moore's Law is fundamentally outdated.
I find it hard to believe that Apple thinks they can make a better watch than *this*: http://t.co/iXovNKkr
Apple rumored to be making a watch. And now, a moment of silence for Casio.
Building technology is just a really elaborate way of making predictions about the future.
Never give up: They said Neil Armstrong wouldn't land on the moon. That Newton couldn't discover gravity. Or that Snapchat would never work.
If Snapchat is the next Facebook, then I officially give up. And by "give up," I mean join Snapchat and probably have a blast.
Snapchat raises a ludicrous amount of money at a ludicrous valuation. Which is exactly what people said about Facebook in 2005.
Why we do what we do: that moment when you get to see the future on your computer screen before the rest of the world.
Linkedin has a patent on beating its numbers. Total domination.
Most important launches in mail history: 1792: US Post Office launched. 1832: The Telegraph launched. 2013: Mailbox is launched.
Often it's not the conclusion that sets the disruptor and disrupted apart, but the speed at which they act on it.
"I saw this video about how scary Gmail is and so I use http://t.co/xL5MKj7O," said 1-2 people who just discovered the internet.
Imagine having extraordinarily talented people, training them to be even more talented, then telling them to leave. Welcome to the US.
2 kinds of entrepreneurs in this world: those that acquire their own company for $24 billion, and everyone else.
"I wish I had waited longer to do a startup," said no one ever. Just go do it.
2012: The year of the IPO. 2013: The year of going private. Trends change fast in this industry.
99.9% of companies could not have transitioned from shipping DVDs, to streaming movies, to making TV shows. All under fire.
Netflix is extremely badass to be making its own shows. This company always avoids disruption like a boss.
I feel like the Super Bowls that happened before Twitter existed shouldn't count.
Laugh now, but when self-driving cars are eligible to play in the Super Bowl, who do you think will win *then*?
This will be a good week to pitch your power outage startup.
96% sure China is behind all of this.
See, this is why you don't control your Super Bowl lights with AWS.
So many dudes will be humming "all the single ladies" this week.
Ok, looks like we're going to have the turn off the internet for Baltimore next week.
GoDaddy just nailed the startup process on that one.
This is the opposite of how things should be going right now.
Dear kids, study computer science. Unless you're good enough to play professional baseball or football. We like that too.
If you don't find yourself asking "Is the world ready for this?" you should go back to the drawing board.
Groundhogs just don't seem as useful once you have a weather app on your phone.

People's Republic of China is the Best! (Please spare my Twitter)
Congrats to all the startups making enterprise software suck less. This Crunchie is for you!
Oscars = Best actors. Grammys = Best singers. ESPYS = Best athletes. Crunchies = People that can't do any of those other things.
"Total Facebook user growth slowed to 25%, to 1.06 billion." Yes, when 2/5 of the entire internet uses your site, growth will slow.
Wait a second. The new Blackberry doesn't have Snapchat. How are real business people supposed to use this thing?
Blackberry getting great reviews. Proud day for all of Canada.
40% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children. Now the US is doing something about it. http://t.co/71jrh5s4
Amazon does $97M in profit and rises 10%. Apple does $13B in profit and falls 10%. Got it.
Yahoo hasn't executed this well since 1994. Unrelated: Yahoo was founded in 1994.
The regret of not taking the risky path &gt; the regret of taking the risky path, and failing.
The evolution of Twitter: 2007: Food I Like; 2009: Breaking News; 2011: Overthrowing Dictators; 2013: Porn.
Well cloud computing was fun while it lasted; now we can just store all our data in DNA strands. http://t.co/tFpdJ9w9
Looking forward to a future when seeing ugly enterprise software is more surprising than seeing well-designed software.
Exxon now worth more than Apple. Going to be a huge year for oil startups.
If anyone has even a mediocre time machine that can only take you back 2 days, buy Netflix stock. Up 70%+.
Apple barely made more profit than Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle combined in the last quarter. LAME.
In the past 5 months, Apple has lost an entire "Microsoft" worth of market cap. That strikes me as extreme.
From the makers of the 140 character limit comes the 6 second video limit. Twitter: reversing Moore's law one format at a time.
Graph search is a lot of fun: "People that work at *Microsoft* and use Facebook for *iPhone*"
Apple posts record revenue, wall street reacts: http://t.co/j1ImQMsp
Apple down 6% after they announce $54 billion in revenue. This is why we can't have nice things.
Apple's earnings in 3 steps: 1. Apple announces it made more money than god. 2. Analysts freak out about something. 3. Repeat.
It seems like if you have to go private to innovate and execute, something is wrong with the public markets.
If your startup is predictable, you're doing it wrong.
Sergey is the only billionaire I'd be afraid to be with alone on a subway. http://t.co/A0TVoaBp
Innovation is hard because "solving problems people didn't know they had" &amp; "building something no one needs" look identical at first.

So Barry Bonds took drugs. Lance Armstrong took drugs. If it turns out The Beatles did drugs, then my childhood was a lie.
The problem with America is politicians think their Job is to win elections and their Customers are only those that vote for them.
A good reminder: "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run"
Worst graph search engine, ever. http://t.co/ho7wXB1m
Honestly, you have to hand it to Microsoft. Their relentless execution with Bing is at least worthy of a golf clap.
Disappointment setting in as regular people discover that Facebook launched a graph search engine, not a giraffe search engine.
Literally just saw a cannonball fly from Facebook HQ toward mountain view.
Facebook's response to Google+: "Two can play that game"
I would need performance enhancing drugs just to go bike shopping. Online.
The gap between "crazy" and "literally impossible" is where the best ideas are hiding out.
I'm confused. None of the nominations for Best Picture appear to be photos of food from Instagram.
The optimist sees the glass half full. The pessimist sees the glass half empty. The entrepreneur wonders how much a glass sells for.
Silicon Valley is a utopian society where engineers root for football teams, rappers promote technology, and cars drive themselves.
For a game that necessitates that one team must lose, people sure do seem surprised when it happens in football.
Startups win by being impatient over a long period of time.
Really sad about -- this article helped inspire me to leave college and move to the valley: http://t.co/yVI1RV83
"Apple to make a cheap iPhone. Wait, no they're not. Actually, yes they might. FML." - Internet
Remember: anything meaningful comes with resistance. The world didn't ask to be changed.
Facebook's stock is up 75% in the past 4 months. So there's that.
The finesse of startups is to solve big problems in the right bite-size chunks.
Steve Ballmer is buying a basketball team to bring to Seattle. Google to respond by obsoleting basketball.
Facebook shares now at $30. Everyone can go back to liking the Internet again.
Just be glad you weren't at CES 25 years ago: "Dozens of companies showcasing digital TV sets, VCRs, and audio tape recorders"
Apple is rumored to be making a lower cost iPhone for emerging markets like China. Yet another reason to move there.
Startups are a battle between insane optimism and sane skepticism.
CES: people travel from all over to play with gadgets and not buy anything. Not to be confused with Best Buy.
CES is just Burning Man with LCD instead of LSD and more clothes.
Entrepreneurship: 10% coach, 20% player, 30% cheerleader, 40% waterboy.

The government has declared that Google is not evil. In other news, Google+ accounts will now replace social security numbers.
This year, $3.7 trillion will be spent on IT. Instead of collecting taxes, the US government should just sell enterprise software.
Microsoft complains they don't get equal access to Youtube APIs. As in, what they did to every company they destroyed in the 90's.
Avis buys Zipcar. To hipsters, this must be tantamount to Walgreens buying Instagram.

Microsoft goes after Apple, Apple goes after Google, Google goes after Facebook, so naturally Facebook goes after a sexting app.

The internet this week: http://t.co/oTPootJ9
Apparently you can save Snapchat videos forever. A few dozen politicians are freaking out right now.
Enterprise disruption occurs because it's easier for a simple product to become advanced than a complex product to become simple.
Startups: This holiday season, be thankful for your incumbents. If their products were better, you couldn't exist.
Snapchat is a primary communication tool for teens. More proof that the internet should have remained a government research project.
After all the mapping disasters this year, it's hard to put too much faith in the accuracy of these Santa tracking tools.
Things said in 1997: "The only sensible conversation to have about Apple is the one in which you argue about how long it will take to die"
Either malls are completely immune to disruption, or way too many people still haven't heard of the internet.
Home for the holidays: a reminder that your parents are harder to appease than any venture capitalist.
2 kinds of organizations in this world: those that would be worse off if Charlie Sheen ran them, and the NRA.
That awkward moment when no one has Poked you yet.
The only thing you can count on as a startup is uncertainty.
Teens these days will have no idea what life was like before you had multiple sexting apps to choose from.
Facebook launches Poke for mobile. Which means, in some small way, the Mayans were right.
If the world doesn't end tomorrow, it will be hard to trust anything the Mayans say anymore.
If the world does actually end tomorrow, the afterlife better have the new iPhone chargers.
Instagram is reverting their terms of service, which means no photos in ads. Internet: 1, Business Models: 0.
Twitter archive is like a trip down memory lane. If by "memory lane" you mean "all the things I regret saying on the internet."
I hear that by agreeing to Instagram's new Terms of Service you also sign away all physical possessions to them.
Every time someone says your idea won't work, just remember they also said that to the guy who came up with the typewriter.
Deciding between consumer and enterprise? In 2012, global online ad spending was $98 billion; Enterprise software was $281 billion.
Microsoft faces more challenges than most realize because personal computing's business model moved from licensing to hardware &amp; ads.
The War in Afghanistan started within 27 days of 9/11. Perhaps we can try to solve our own issues as quickly as we can attack others.
For a nation that has benefited immensely from progress, we really suck at change.
Perspective: NRA's annual budget: ~$250 million. PBS: ~$300 million.
So wait, let me get this straight. When you do nothing about a problem, it doesn't just go away on its own? Interesting.
Apple Maps officially takes the award for "shortest time to obsolescence", right after the Zune.
Startups win by solving problems large enough that they matter, but small enough that incumbents don't yet care.
Google Maps for iPhone is now live. This must be how people felt when maps started getting the oceans right in the 1500's.
The Pope has tweeted 7 times in the past 12 hours. Someone at the Vatican has been binging on social media webinars recently.
The battle in enterprise software is moving from being about delivery model to being about design.
The inventor of photo filters would be so proud of what has become of the internet.
Without Instagram on Twitter, we must all go back to eating our food with no one ever knowing what it looked like in black &amp; white.Anytime you wonder why an international conflict is so hard to resolve, just remember the valley goes to war over photos with filters.
The story of Hanukkah is about an oil supply that lasted for eight days instead of one. It's really just a giant ad for the Prius.
So the SEC doesn't like Reed Hastings posting Netflix news on Facebook. That's fine, Pinterest is better for these disclosures anyway.

To the person who's been rain dancing in Silicon Valley: mission accomplished.
The goal is to have a job that you don't describe as "work".
Time + relentless execution is often a solid strategy. Sometimes it's just about outlasting the other guy.
Don't just chase after a market. Build a company.
Everyone's goal is to hire the best, execute the best, and build the best products. It's discipline setting apart those that do.

This industry is not for the faint of heart: 4 years ago Apple and HP were worth the same amount. Now Apple is worth 25X more.
Well that's the story of the century: HP had a market cap of $120B five years ago. A little over $20B today.
How Internet Explorer has more than 4% market share should be a mystery to us all, and studied by professors everywhere.

Momentum is everything: Blackberry had a $60B market cap on $6B in revenue 5 years ago. Today, a $4.4B market cap on $11B in revenue.
Microsoft's challenge is that unlike Apple, which has trained us to flock to every update, there's little impetus to upgrade to Win8

Hard reality of the Nate Silver era: data makes opinions obsolete.
Everything comes down to the ease by which you navigate contradictions. Speed vs. Quality; Simplicity vs. Breadth; Lean vs. Scale.

There should be a reality show about people watching Bravo's Silicon Valley reality show.
This is just an assumption, but it's probably pretty hard to fall asleep tonight if you're running for president.
Bravo's Silicon Valley show will be great for startup recruiting. If you showed what actually happens out here, no one would come.

Remember: company culture is never static. You're either always improving it, or it's decaying.
At most companies, the iPad Mini would've stalled because it cannibalizes an existing product line. At Apple, they say "screw it."
The laptop replaced the desktop. Tablet replaced the laptop. Mini tablet replaces the tablet. And the phone is just like "whatever".
What's the difference between Apple and the IRS? You can evade taxes.
The iPad Mini nailed it. Anyone who thinks there's a comparable Android tablet is either very confused or works for Google.
Nothing is certain but death, taxes, and a lot of people buying iPad Minis this weekend.
Savvy kids trick-or-treating in Palo Alto should be asking for stock options instead of butterfingers.

Tim Cook compares Windows 8 to a car that flies and floats. That's about the best testimonial you can get.
Tech industry trifecta: ‚òë Facebook's stock up 20%. ‚òë Apple announces a miniature iPad. ‚òë A Microsoft product gets good reviews.

Conclusion from debate: we must fear all other countries, as they will attack us with either nukes or low-cost tires.
Obama: when I went to Israel, I had a Bar Mitzvah.
That awkward moment when both presidential candidates realize they don't disagree on foreign policy enough to debate it.
#6: Binders full of Women.
This debate is like Mixed Martial Arts meets Wikipedia.
Obama is destroying the Cardinals right now. Or something like that.
FACT: Every time you compromise on design, a baby seal gets separated from its family.
The chart that changes the future of computing: http://t.co/BlxlTgC6
Most industries don't operate "as they should," but rather "as they have." The opportunity for startups is to make the former true.
Companies lose when they begin to think of evolution as an "event." Change is constant.
‚ÄúThe key threat to Microsoft, however, is not other companies but a big technology change.‚Äù NYT in 1991. Right idea, 20 years early.
The moment no one thinks innovation is left in a market is often when there's the most.
We've moved from a world where one company controlled 90%+ of "computers" to one where no player has 50%+. This changes everything.
The future is far too often in the hands of people that you don't trust the present with.
In small companies, nothing takes longer than it should; in big companies, nothing happens as fast as it could.
Google's financial results are filed early, loses $20B in market cap. Worst intern, ever.
So. Color is either shutting down, or being acquired by the most valuable company in the world. Got it.
"I hate it when people aren't frustrated by the internet" - inventor of the CAPTCHA.
Oracle goes cloud. Microsoft does devices. Tech companies are going through more reinvention than the Romney campaign.
LinkedIn's initial pitch in 2003 was actually "Binders Full of Women for the Web."
After tonight's debate, running for president no longer seems that enjoyable after all.
Debate best practice: spend 80% not answering the question and 20% blaming your opponent for something unrelated.
Mitt's binder of women was bigger than any other state! #probinder
Hopefully Obama has been listening to The Final Countdown and watching The Mighty Ducks over and over for the past week.
Obama: remember, ambiens are to be taken *after* the debate, not before. Good luck!
Microsoft is going to spend billions of dollars convincing consumers that the Windows desktop is dead. That's commitment to survival.
The right answer to your business model issue, product decision, or team challenge is far simpler than you're making it.
Xbox Music to launch soon. Zune's ~300 users are so pumped right now.
We no longer send people to space, so I guess we'll have to settle for people falling from space.
Time Traveler's Checklist: ‚òê Warn Tupac to leave Vegas early. ‚òê Tell Lincoln to avoid theaters. ‚òê Buy Workday IPO shares.
Startups: discover your unfair advantage and exploit it relentlessly.
When a startup says "We're looking to hire a rockstar engineer," rockstars are probably like "The music business sure is changing."
Workday shares up 73% in IPO. If you aren't starting an enterprise software company this weekend, you've lost your mind.
http://t.co/lB4211fv exists to remind us of how badly we need more computer science education in the US.
Vice President options: the annoying kid from debate club, or his dad.
Vice President candidates are great because they don't even pretend to like each other.
Workday's IPO is like having a time machine that takes you back Oracle's IPO. Disclosure: I'm bullish on enterprise software.
"Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons." - Popular Mechanics foreshadowing the iPad Mini in 1949.
By market cap: Apple (Post-PC) &gt; Google (Cloud) &gt; Microsoft (PC) &gt; IBM (Mainframe)
BoxWorks 2012 is on! Earliest I've been awake in my entire life.
You know who wouldn't have a problem with the accuracy of Apple Maps? Christopher Columbus.
Remember: "There's absolutely no way this will work" has been said about every important innovation in history.
Enterprise software is being disrupted by solutions that serve the user, not an RFP. Reverse this at your peril.
BoxWorks starts tomorrow! Hope you're enjoying the fighter jets we hired to fly over SF in celebration of the cloud.
You don't win by never being wrong, but rather by going *big* when you're right.
Building technology is amazing because you  get to turn ideas into reality without ever once asking for permission.
Entrepreneurs live on a steady diet of daydreams and nightmares.
If you don't have a billion users, you're not working hard enough.
It took the world hundreds of thousands of years to reach a billion users. Facebook did it in under 9.
The next debate should be moderated by drying paint.
"I want to thank Mitt Romney. I think this was a terrific debate." Translation: "If you take my job I will break you."
Presidential debate translations: Smile = "I believe you are lying, sir."  Chuckle = "I hate you so much right now."
In the ideal American political system, the loser of tonight's debate would have to go on American Idol.
Innovation is solving problems people didn't know they had in ways they didn't think were possible.
Curiosity + Moore's Law is the gift that keeps on giving.
"Google‚Äôs not a real company. It‚Äôs a house of cards" -Steve Ballmer in '04. Since then, these cards have increased by 400% in value.
Oracle recently discovered cloud computing, so you can expect to be hearing about it all week.
Gorgeous day in California, perfect for going to the beach and having a picnic. And by that I mean making PowerPoint presentations.
You can't build a differentiated product without building a differentiated culture.
Opportunity = (Future) - (Present)
If no one thinks your idea is crazy, it probably sucks.
Apple CEO recommends people use Bing for something. We are witnessing history being made folks.
We can only assume "We Are The Champions" is playing on repeat at the Google Maps HQ.
More time is spent on Instagram than Twitter on mobile. Proving yet again that Zuckerberg's crystal ball &gt; everyone else's.
Blackberry's stock is up today, Yahoo has a strategy, and Myspace is coming back. Time travelers from 2005 must be annoyed.
Driverless cars are becoming legal in California. Best part about being a robot: getting to avoid the DMV.
Myspace is apparently going to relaunch soon. Which means we're only months away from a Geocities comeback.
Top 3 fears: 1. Fear of spiders. 2. Fear of flying. 3. Fear of being seen with an iPhone 4 at work tomorrow.
Don't confuse building a niche solution for building a wedge. Wedges let you expand, niche markets often shrink.
Now Paul Graham says you should do startups that can grow. Ruins my idea of a Zappos for shoelaces. http://t.co/G6TyuekI
Getting to the future is always held up by those trying to protect the past.
Buying an iPhone 5 is the perfect way to say, "I don't need directions. I got this."
Congratulations San Francisco. NASA considers you to be similar enough to exploring outer space.
If you aren't in line to buy an iPhone 5 right now you're basically unpatriotic.
Camping out to get an iPhone 5 is our generation's Woodstock.
We take too much for granted these days. Consumers 500 years ago had maps missing entire continents and you didnt see them complain.
Yes, only the paranoid survive. But damn, paranoia is a bitch.
No one ever got anywhere that interesting by being "realistic".
Thanks man! Though I really could have used this support back when I was running for president of the middle school chess club.When a big company follows your footsteps, they might know the path you've been down, but not the one you're taking next.
Salesforce announces Chatterbox. I can't tell if it took them 7 seconds or 9 seconds to think of that name.
All iPhone 5 unboxings should be accompanied by Seal's "Kiss From A Rose" playing in the background.
Dreamforce is the Olympics of tech events. Except instead of unparalleled athletic feats, we discuss cloud computing.
"Ok looks like that viral video didn't work." - Romney social media advisor.
Google+ is the Narnia of social networks. It's this mythical place that we'll log in to one day and everyone is there waiting.
Fun fact: It took 74 days for the first iPhone to sell one million units, and in 24 hours two million iPhone 5s are presold.
Chinese New Year has dragons and fireworks. For Jewish New Year you eat apple slices.
Some perspective: It took Apple 30 years to reach a market cap of $50 Billion, Microsoft 20 years, Amazon 16 years, Facebook only 8.
Stanford beats USC. It's about to get crazy in Palo Alto. Expecting a lot of celebratory all night coding binges.
Those with good fortune take their winnings, those on a mission keep doubling down.
Innovation happens at the crossroads of frustration with the present and blind optimism about the future.
Only 148,604 people have a valid excuse for not pre-ordering an iPhone 5. This is how many people work at Microsoft and Google.
Anyone who didn't pre-order an iPhone 5 last night is probably a luddite who's against industrialization and still on Windows 95.
When picking a market as a startup you should: 1. Pick one that's underestimated. 2. Be right about #1.
They said cloud wouldn't work in traditional enterprises. Box's 3 biggest deals are with companies that were founded in the 1800s.
Facebook market cap is $4 Billion higher since Zuckerberg spoke on Tuesday. Best 30 minutes of work, ever.
The new iPhone weighs only 112 grams. At this rate, the iPhone 6 is just going to be an edible wafer.
What do Clayton Christensen, Marc Andreessen, Weezer and cloud computing have in common? BoxWorks 2012. http://t.co/vgaNROlM
Ok so iPhone 5 may not solve world hunger, but will solve world GDP.
Disappointed that the new iPod Shuffle doesn't make random phone calls.
This is a groundbreaking day for earbud enthusiasts.
Apple's response to Spotify? Letting you play song samples and browse AT THE SAME TIME.
Siri is so prepared for a future where our hands no longer function.
I hope they announce the iPhone 6 as the "one more thing",
Enjoy these final moments with your phone. It will be obsolete in 24 hours.
Facebook stock up on the news that Zuckerberg said the word "revenue"
Zuckerberg should just live stream his strategy to the world every morning and the stock would do fine.
A startup without competition is like a rapper without a rival. It's just awkward.
About to go discuss enterprise software at Disrupt. I will consider it a success if the consumer guys don't boo us off stage.
The finesse of startups is to do things *just* before the world is ready and keep pushing until it is.
So it turns out Jessica Alba is a startup founder. I really would have guessed a .0001% chance to have the same profession as her.
Big companies exist to keep the world running, startups exist to show us where the world's going.
If everyone's at Disrupt, who's keeping the internet up right now?
If your startup isn't doing something that was technically impossible 24 months ago, go back to the drawing board.
That moment when everyone on Twitter turns into a football fan.
"I wish there were more smartphones to choose from" - said by no consumer in 2012.
The PC digitized work for hundreds of millions of people in offices, Post-PC digitizes work for a billion+ people outside the office.

SUPER awkward if Obama doesn't accept the nomination.
Anyone who thinks things were better 4 years ago needs a new stockbroker: http://t.co/DOTjlegE
Progress is not more hate, more guns, and more inequities. It's more education, more infrastructure, and more opportunity.
Strange that Bill Clinton can communicate without talking to a chair or doing ventriloquism. My hope in America returns.
Apparently, these days the only difference between a nuisance and a visionary is their stock price 90 days after IPO.
15 years ago there was 1 dominant OS with too much control and only 100Ms of devices. Now 3 compete for developers with 1B+ devices.
Droid RAZR! 2004 is so pumped up right now.
The ideal political system would have 0 parties and just be a SurveyMonkey sent to all citizens to vote on individual issues.
At some point, every startup has joked "we need a meeting to discuss our meetings." Later, that meeting actually happens. And you cry.
Obama's new campaign slogan: Michelle Obama's Husband.
Maybe something can all agree on: Michelle Obama for President.
Startups are amazing forces because they lack baggage, politics, and inertia; complicate that at your own peril.
There should be a public service announcement to warn consumers about the risks of buying a phone before the iPhone 5 is out.
iPhone 5: in case you didn't think Apple's stock could go higher.
Often the best ideas happen at the intersection of self-doubt and deep conviction.
It‚Äôs rare that tech incumbents avoid what‚Äôs in their best interest, they just can‚Äôt move as fast as is required to avoid disruption.
Given the state of America, I'm 80% sure we have Senators who think Labor Day is the day when all the babies arrive.
Labor Day was introduced in 1894 to celebrate the efforts of US workers. And by that I mean, to extend Burning Man by an extra day.
Competition is great for innovation. Microsoft hasn‚Äôt worked this hard to be relevant since Bill dropped out of Harvard in 1975.
If you don‚Äôt have at least one failure daily, you‚Äôre not taking enough risks.
Start something that no one thinks will work, but would be enormous if it did.
Our political system is FUBAR: imagine running a company where 50% of the organization was incentivized to make you unsuccessful.
Whenever your startup goes through a rough patch, just imagine what it feels like to be RadioShack. http://t.co/1IGze3Mx
When you're doing something you're passionate about, stress becomes a feature not a bug.
Workday is a blueprint for enterprise software domination. Modern approach to $40B market with slow incumbents. Will have mega IPO.
You have to feel bad for Clint Eastwood. The guy probably thought Nixon was still in office during that speech.
True Fact: this is the latest Mitt Romney has ever stayed up. #yolo
Election season would be more fun if sitting presidents did more badass moves, like, "kill electricity in Florida... now".
In some markets you win by running faster, in others by running longer. Given you never know which you're in, do both.
As president you spend year 1 fixing the last guy's blunders, 2-3 congress prevents any progress &amp; 4 is spent defending the first 3
US Politics: Everyone gets a choice, half of the people are happy with the outcome, and no one wins.
If Obama can go on Reddit, then literally nothing is impossible for our country at this point.
2 kinds of people in the world: those that find more reasons why something won't work than why it will. And those that don't care.
Ok, can everyone come back from burning man now? The internet is pretty dull this week.
Apple wants to block 8 Samsung phones from being sold in the US, after winning $1B. Note to self: don't get on Apple's bad side.
What's the difference between Apple and God?  Nothing. So I'd actually be expecting a lawsuit here pretty soon...
So IAC now owns http://t.co/teR5T4KF, Excite and http://t.co/iSvR4gGw. It's good to know the Internet has a retirement home.
To everyone at Burning Man: this may not be protocol, but if you run into any good iOS engineers, please send their resumes along.
Silicon Valley: hyper-productive for 11.75 months of the year. Then, right on cue, everyone heads to the desert to go naked dancing.
I'll start doing burning man once there's ubiquitous wifi, restaurants on-site, and it's indoors.
Patent paradox: if every innovation that was patentable based on today's law was patented and litigated, innovation would halt.
You know what's #yolo? Going to the moon.
Patent suits have a funny way of making you not know whether you feel happy for innovation or sad for innovation.
$1B in damages. Must. Start. Patenting. Everything.
"Going enterprise" is the new "building social games"
Anyone who can bike 2,000 miles without dying is good in my book.
Person A: "Quick! We need a new logo." Person B: "I know how to draw squares...?" http://t.co/HentDbxM
Leave it to Microsoft to do their first logo update in 25 years using MS Paint.
Always start with the assumption that the world won't make it easy for your startup to win, and go from there.
Silicon Valley gave birth to 75 new startups today. Good luck to everyone. The fun is just getting started!
Why you can disrupt the enterprise market: http://t.co/INbVzHfd
Cloud computing = Radical Efficiency http://t.co/FuxkfG3C
Startups have it way better now. Back in my day, to pitch investors, you had to walk up a sand hill both ways, barefoot in the snow.
Silicon Valley right now: 2 of the biggest tech companies are suing each other into oblivion while 80 others are getting their start.
If you never sold your stock, that would sort of defeat the whole point of investing.
Apple is now the biggest company in the history of the world. At this point they should just auto-withdrawal from our bank accounts.
Opportunities never end: big companies create gaps, startups fill them. Startups grow into big companies. Process repeats. Forever.
Perhaps we need elected officials to take advanced aptitude tests with questions like, "do you know how babies are made?"
Depressing fact of the day: our taxes pay for Todd Akin's salary.
The bad news: robots are replacing us. The good news: we'll get low cost goods up until the end of our species. http://t.co/qRYD1zRm
Henry Ford nails it: A business absolutely devoted to service will have only one worry about profits. They will be embarrassingly large.
Companies have never "won". You're always either fighting for survival, or fighting for relevance.
To all the customers out there taking technology to the edge of what's possible, showing vendors the future, you guys fucking rock.
The flaw with protesting Twitter is that it invariably requires the use of Twitter. Well played.
Few strategies are better than utter relentlessness.
Twitter's API has more rules than North Korea.
It's basically a part-time job just keeping up with how Square is defeating credit cards. The hours are flexible, but the pay sucks.
If you're a startup, "after work" is an oxymoron.
When I first used Writely (Google Docs) in 2005 my head exploded in a burst of cloud joy. Insanely excited to have its creator join Box.
iPad Mini: because you still have some discretionary income *not* being spent on Apple products today. And that must be stopped.
Before starting a company, ask yourself: will this idea be boring in 5 years. If so, slowly back away from the incorporation docs.
Dammit. Evan Williams launches a new way to communicate just as I was getting good at Twitter. He does this every time.
Cloud computing is superior to mainframes in nearly every way, except for one. Users' hairstyles. http://t.co/yV9NeRy1
30 years before the iMac, there was this bad boy: http://t.co/O5Riz3GY
A week ago we landed on Mars. Today, the Spice Girls reunited. I'm beginning to run out of life goals here.
Twitter should launch that feature where everything starts working properly.
Winning over your competitor's customers &lt; Winning over the market that never adopted a solution in the first place.
If Mitt and Paul get elected, I wonder if they'll get to keep their side jobs as L.L. Bean catalog models.
Plagiarism is just really inefficient hyperlinking.
Most technology is solving problems that teleportation will eventually make obsolete.
25 years ago the addressable market for enterprise software was millions of workers. 10 years ago it was 100Ms. Now it's 1B+.
Just some of the amazing things we've seen in our lifetime: landing on Mars, toppling of dictators, Googlers going over to Yahoo.
There are 2 kinds of entrepreneurs in the world: those of us with flaws, and Jack Dorsey.
Ultimate fail: flash crashing your browser as you're trying to get a new version to stop crashing your browser http://t.co/9nN4UuEK
It's Jack Dorsey's world, we're all just living in it.
Square just dropped a bomb on the retail payments industry, in one of those Godfather-dead-horse-in-your-bed epic move moments.
The role of CEO is equal parts cheerleader and paranoid schizophrenic.
‚òë Higgs Boson Discovery,  ‚òë Mars Rover Landing,  ‚òê Apple TV
I think it should be a mandate that every week gets kicked off by landing something on another planet.
To all the crazy parents of NASA employees, who let their kids experiment with jet propulsion in the backyard, we salute you.
WE OWN YOU MARS.
I bet the Mars Rover doesn't have to turn off all electronics before landing. Take that FAA.
If any Martians are reading this, we come in peace. Seriously.
The Mars Rover has to fly 350,000,000 miles to do its job. It turns out your commute isn't so bad after all.
Apparently the only thing hard about landing the Mars Rover is that it's traveling 13,000 MILES PER HOUR.
"Mars appears to be cooperating very nicely with us" - Stuff people at NASA get to say.
Michael Phelps is the fastest swimmer in the world. If he could just apply that to programming, he'd really be onto something.

Someone has apparently slipped an innovation drug into Microsoft's water supply recently. This is getting interesting.
We're witnessing the most significant enterprise IT shift in history, which is why Box raised $125M: http://t.co/glWJRXU2
Your goal should be to build a team so great that you're unqualified to be on it.
Microsoft's challenges are simple. They put a computer on every desk and in every home but forgot to put one in everyone's hand.
Instead of Archery and Judo, there should be an Olympics for modern survival skills, like typing really fast and SEO optimization.
Being an entrepreneur is like being an Olympic swimmer. Wait, no. There are actually zero similarities. We would drown.
Every 4 years we're reminded that the world is, in fact, breeding a group of superhumans capable of defending us when robots attack.
"Running to pitch meetings" should be an Olympic sport, so Silicon Valley could participate.
Zynga misses its numbers, stock drops. Facebook hits its numbers, stock drops. These are very confusing rules, Wall Street.
You haven't spent enough time on a design process unless you want to tase yourself by the end.
The difference between private and public investors is while one will stick with you through hiccups, the other exacerbates them.
The fate of the entire Internet rests in Zuckerberg's hands this afternoon. No pressure.
Just think: someone goes to work every day in a suit and tie and analyzes the financial results of something called "Bubble Safari"
Sometimes the disrupted win: Union Pacific Railroad is worth more than Delta, Southwest, United, and American Airlines combined.
Why service matters the most: with enough time your technology can always be matched, but your customer relationships can't.
Some perspective: Apple's "miss" is still more profit than any other tech company has generated in a quarter in history.
The bad news: Apple misses. The good news: Beers are on Steve Ballmer all week.
If you're consistently achieving your goals, they're not big enough.
Xerox invented laser printers, GUIs, object-oriented programming, the mouse, ethernet and is now worth slightly more than PetSmart.
Enterprise software is being disrupted by apps that don't feel like they're designed by the government or priced like a small country.
Hire people that extend your company‚Äôs boundaries. Avoid those that try to stay within them.
Entrepreneurs are just astronauts who are not physically qualified to be astronauts.
Startups are for people that wanted to climb ice, race boats, and heli-ski, but only had enough money for web hosting bills.
Businesses worldwide manage 2.2 zettabytes of data. A.K.A. 37,795,712,200 64GB iPhones.
Dubstep is our generation's Yanni.
The best startup ideas are windows into a future that everyone wants to be a part of.
Startups are like playing chess against Bobby Fischer. The good news is he‚Äôs blindfolded. The bad news is he's got 10X more pawns.

Q: Is enterprise technology lame or really epic?  A: Palo Alto Networks jumps 35% after IPO.
Enterprise startups are like the nerdy kid in school that grows up to become Brad Pitt. And by "Brad Pitt", I mean have a mega IPO.
Don't fail so fast that you miss¬†the opportunity to succeed.
I wonder if when Steve Jobs came up with the iPad, he was all like, "We will need Movies, Games, and lots of Cash Register apps"
Every day an important company isn't being started because someone is underestimating the upside and overestimating the downside.
Show me a market leader that is compromising on their product and I'll show you a disruption opportunity.
It's been almost 48 hours. Has the Yahoo turnaround happened yet?
"Oh hey let's release a film the same weekend as Dark Knight" - worst movie studio exec ever.
If Marissa can‚Äôt fix Yahoo, it can‚Äôt be done.  Her *relevant* mix of leadership, product vision, and credibility is unparalleled.
I suddenly find myself visiting Yahoo today, but not to be ironic.
That awkward moment when Yahoo starts being able to retain and hire engineering talent.
There is some serious Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker style sh*t going down in the valley right now.
Yeah yeah yeah new Microsoft Office. HOLY SHIT Marissa Mayer running Yahoo.
Microsoft hasn't had to compete this hard in years. It's like watching a bear emerge from a decade-long hibernation.
Entrepreneurs are just mad scientists with a business model.
Let's just agree that this is how we describe cloud to our moms: SaaS is Crate and Barrel, PaaS is IKEA, and IaaS is Home Depot.
Call me crazy, but I think capitalism thrives in a world where people get equal access to great healthcare, education, and jobs.
Company cultures are like Jelly Beans. They come in lots of flavors, and the best ones are never the plain kind.
Competition is good. You tend to run faster when you're being chased.
Before doing a startup, be sure to clear your calendar for the next decade. You might be at this for a while.
Your job as manager is to be a clock, your job as leader is to be a compass, and your job as founder is to be a swiss army knife.
Capitalism is perpetual becauese the motivation of wanting is so much greater than the satisfaction of having.
I miss the days when an internship meant making people coffee, faxing stuff, and copying things that are never read.
To anyone starting a "Pinterest for dudes," see Exhibit A: Digg
Sure, Digg should have sold to Google in 2008; but with that logic, Facebook would have sold to Yahoo, and Google to Excite.
In other news, Digg is indestructible.Any time the crowd is going in one direction, there's a business to be made in another.
Remember: there's a huge chasm in between converting a product from novelty to utility. Don't fall into it.
It costs nearly the same to design something well as it does to design it poorly, and yet the pain is so different.
Microsoft Stores are great because they offer a nice and quiet place to relax when you're at the mall.
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it" - said the company just about to be disrupted.
Steve Ballmer must be wondering how he got stuck having to turn around Microsoft while Bill Gates gets to go save the world.
Why there's so much disruption today: most markets we think have been "won" are actually just a fraction of their potential size.
A Silicon Valley reality show may expose our dark side: lavish top ramen meals, bitter fights about UI, and hardcore coding binges.
There's a difference between "get shit done" and "get shitty done"
New startup best practice: $100M Series A.
Dear Members of the World: The ‚Äòsubject‚Äô line on emails is there to be filled with text. Leave blank at your peril.
Your company's culture is not what it is because of what you say, but because of what you do.
Dear Kids: Inflation in last 5 years: 11%; Starting pay for computer science grad increase: 40%.
The Talent Wars in Silicon Valley would be far more interesting if we allowed the use of cannonballs.
Joining a startup is just like climbing a mountain without the necessary gear, in a violent storm. Except you get stock options.
Instead of being a small fish in a big pond, or a big fish in a small pond, just find a way to sell worms to all the fish.
Paradoxically, there's an inverse relationship between how well software is designed and its price.
Yahoo agrees to not sue Facebook over patents. This feels eerily like Yahoo not doing something self-destructive.
If your vision doesn't seem ludicrous, you're probably not aiming high enough.
"Building your own phone" is the new "launching a website."
Enterprise software is being disrupted because existing solutions provide half of the value needed, at double the cost expected.
Startups should be solving for a world where the device in our hand is more useful than the device on our desk.
So it turns out that Crackberry is not as addictive as real crack.
Not a bad week to be a Quantum Physicist. They probably haven't partied this hard since the neutron was discovered.
Higgs Boson has more users than Google+.
Proof of inflation: gravity was discovered with only an apple; now it takes 10,000 scientists and a 17 mile tube to find a particle.
Higgs Boson cost $9 billion to discover. Particle valuations are now skyrocketing.
Looking forward to the spectacular July 4th firework shows! That I'll read about on Twitter.
Product design is one part art, one part science, and eight parts hysteria.
I think we can all agree that the founding fathers would have been really against on-premise software.
Given our $1.1 Trillion debt to China, they must think the US celebrates Independence Day to be ironic.
I'd love to see the Google search history of our founding fathers. "How to start a country"; "Best constitutions of all time"
The great thing about the word "nontrivial" is it instantly makes you look smart and it's really hard to mess up.
The best technology is aimed far enough in the future that it stands out, but close enough to the present that it blends in.
236 years ago, Twitter was a dude yelling in a town square, Linkedin was just your last name, and you played FarmVille to survive.
Sometimes the valley is strange. Facebook not playing with Google; Twitter not playing with Linkedin; Apple playing with no one.
Here's why openness wins: "There are always more smart people outside your company than within it." - Bill Joy
Definition of disruption: nearly every category of enterprise software will have a different leader in 5 years than the one today.
Fireworks literally going off in the valley.  Must be celebrating Amazon Web Services coming back online.
Your product can always be copied, but your organization can't.
Instagram is still down. This is for sure a Kodak Moment.
AWS is taking down half the Internet. Time to go hang out on Yahoo.
Stay Curious: Microsoft was started after Gates read about the Altair; Oracle when Ellison read a paper on relational databases.
Blackberry stock fell 19% today. If I'm getting my sports analogies right, this is what they call "unnecessary roughness."
Really hard to watch Blackberry keep falling. Owning one was the first time I ever looked like I was doing something important.
Today was a great day for everyone who enjoys freedom, democracy, and Google App Engine.
Google's glasses will be great for checking your email in a meeting while totally seeming like you're paying attention.
Google is focused. On everything.

Hiring trick: make sure everyone you hire is someone you'd want in your company's mafia.
All of a sudden optometry is going to be a pretty badass profession.

Running a startup is like having all the bad guys from Die Hard attack you, but you‚Äôre way more scrawny than Bruce Willis.
Some advice to the last 20%: you should learn to be as fun and easy going as the first 80%.
You can't compete in the enteprise if you're changing software annually for businesses that change daily.
Anyone thinking Microsoft overpaid for Yammer doesn't get Microsoft's scale, their time horizon, or the size of disruption happening
Yammer is billion dollar proof of the future of enterprise software: viral, end-user driven, social, simple and freemium.
The best part about getting acquired by Microsoft is free MS Office Licenses for life! Followed by the $1.2 Billion.
Steve Ballmer finally got around to reading the Innovator's Dilemma. Congrats Microsoft + Yammer.
If you're not executing at 10X the speed of your largest competitor, you're doing it wrong.
Given he barely helped start Facebook, his whole "bitten by a radioactive spider" story is way less credible. http://t.co/5eVhjkdk
#1 hiring mistake: hiring people based on the job to be done today instead of the job to be done tomorrow.
If Facebook returns to its IPO price this week, the entire Internet owes Zuckerberg an apology.
It sucks that there's no correlation between playing Monopoly and ability to build one. You only get a weird interest in railroads.
If someone doesn't like your idea, remind them a dude in 1903 said "The horse is here to stay, but the automobile is only a novelty"
Focus on what your competitor's business model prevents them from focusing on.
Focus is about deciding what the customer will value so disproportionately that the rest doesn't matter.
What do you call someone who has strange visions of the future, is highly paranoid, and can't hold a regular job? Entrepreneur.
Enterprises to spend $120B on apps this year.  Also known as 240 islands for Larry Ellison. http://t.co/IWEyOkNq
I'm just going to safely assume nothing important happened in the world while Twitter was down.
The shocking news today should be that Larry Ellison didn't previously own an island.
You guys always were more strategic than us...
We want... signups?
There should be a ride at Disneyland called "The Startup." It would be the scariest, least structurally sound roller coaster ever.
Whoever said ‚Äúpatience is a virtue‚Äù probably didn‚Äôt have that much competition.
Today is a glorious day for Microsoft fanboys. Be proud.

When I'm a device manufacturer and Microsoft just launched Surface, I'm just like... http://t.co/0ppYJYuY
Sorry, not buying a Microsoft Surface until it supports Zip Drives
Microsoft Surface: no feature left behind!
I'm 90% sure Microsoft doesn't know what they're announcing today either.
Blogs made it hard for me to read full articles. Now tweets make blogs hard to read. Soon, I'll only be able to consume shapes.
The best organizations are optimized for thoughtful tension, not thoughtless conformity.
Dad, thanks for getting me my first computer. Though, I'm still bitter that it was a refurbished PC instead of a Mac.
Best quote of 1876 goes to: ‚ÄúThis 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication‚Äù
Startups are for people that wanted to run marathons, cage fight, and hunt alligators, but were born with asthma.
Officially in London. Looking forward to castles, scones, tea time, and Jude Law sightings.
I'm going to be on an airplane and without internet for 10 hours. Please, no more acquisitions until I land.
Instagram: $1B. Yammer: $1.2B.  And that, my friends, is why you do enterprise software.
Microsoft's 5 Stages of Grief about enterprise software's future: 1. Denial; 2. Anger; 3. Bargaining; 4. Depression; 5. Buy Yammer.
The cloud is disruptive to legacy players not because the technology is hard to replicate, but because the organizational DNA is.
If Microsoft doesn't acquire Yammer, I hear their backup plan is to launch a direct competitor by 2017.
The SF Giants use Box. The SF Giants have a no-hitter. I rest my case.
Microsoft buying Yammer would be their best strategic move since launching MS-DOS
Best quote of the 70's officially goes to: "There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home."
gLTDs are probably the worst thing for the internet since the invention of the popup ad.
Apple is shutting down Ping. Apparently "social graphs" do better with people.
There's far more risk in working for a big company you don't enjoy than a startup you do.
The future of enterprise technology will be like if Pinterest and Oracle had little software babies.
In one of life's great ironies, cloud computing really sucks when you're flying in an airplane.
The Department of Justice should evaluate whether or not Apple has an illegal monopoly in awesomeness.
Did you hear about that thing not related to Apple today?  Nope, neither did I.
"I'm concerned this isn't better than a PC"¬†said no one at Apple ever.
That awkward moment when you bought the old MacBook last week.
Email length is proportional to how much happiness you want to take away from your recipients.
It‚Äôs not the size of the startup in the fight, it‚Äôs the size of the fight inside the startup.
"I'm really satisfied with where the product is at." said no founder ever.
Whoever said ‚Äúnothing good in life comes easy‚Äù clearly didn‚Äôt predict cloud computing.
Startups are like sharks: you must keep moving or you die. But unlike sharks, hiring the wrong people will kill you sooner.
I'd rather risk making the wrong decision by moving too fast than have no decision left to make by moving too slow.
Oracle Cloud is so good it doesn't even need to be on-demand: "Oracle will notify you once your instance is ready for activation"
The new Twitter bird looks like it has a huge attitude problem.
The best companies realize they're not in the technology business, they're in the talent business.
I bet we'd get world peace and solve world hunger if we no longer had any meetings.
When you say, "I want to do a startup," I hear, "I enjoy pain, suffering, paranoia, anxiety, volatility, and want that 24/7."
The 10X designer is more elusive than the 10X engineer.
Timeless inequity: startups have bigger visions than resources, and big companies have the opposite.
First Larry Ellison joins Twitter. Then Oracle goes cloud. I'm betting some announcement with Digg is to follow.
Tech stocks rebounding today.  Take that, Paul Graham memo!
The best startups are bets on markets that won‚Äôt exist until tomorrow with technology that only became possible today.
Paul Graham's memo really puts a damper on the launch of my new gold-encrusted yacht sharing startup.
If we're no longer in a bubble, then does anyone want to buy my car? http://t.co/aDqwIpOh
Great product management is 1% concept and 99% details.
In the future, kids will flock to the enterprise software companies at career day.
Someone should invent a time machine, go back 3 weeks, and warn Facebook about its IPO. Then go back a year, and start Instagram.
You can't change the game if you play by the existing rules.
The only difference between startups in Silicon Valley and San Francisco is that the latter disproportionately values brunch
I‚Äôd rather be early to a market and persistent than late and redundant.
You‚Äôve succeeded at hiring when you‚Äôre the worst person to do any particular job inside your company.
Enterprise software startups are like mullets.  Business in the front, party in the back.
Never underestimate working harder as a differentiator.
In the future, countries won't be brought down by nuclear weapons, but instead by infected email jokes from our grandparents.
The worm is mightier than the bomb.
Windows 8 seems neat and all, but I'm already on Windows 95.
The paradox of having big ideas is that you need to start with small products to make them a reality.
Looking forward to the day when kids will say they want to be an astronaut when they grow up, and that's just a regular job.
Take the money allocated for marketing and use it to maximize whatever differentiates you so spectacularly that you need none
The next 5 years for Enterprise IT will be more productive, innovative, and transformative than the last 30 combined.
You should be experiencing pain in the product development process so your customers don't have to.
In the future, math teachers will explain bell curves using Blackberry's stock graph.
OH: RSS
If your startup has somehow combined mobile, social, local, cloud, and gamification, you probably need to see a therapist.
Enterprises couldn't justify saying "yes" to cloud previously; now, they can't afford to say "no."
Life is too short to not be working on a once in lifetime opportunity.
Making phones is so 2012. To one up Google, Facebook should build Augmented Reality Ski Goggles.
I heard that one innovation of the Facebook Phone is that it doesn't actually vibrate or ring. It just pokes you.
30 years ago EA was founded to bring state-of-the-art engineering to games. Now, we just want to draw shapes with our fingers.
First there was the Dot-com Bubble. Then the Housing Bubble. Now, we have officially entered the Facebook IPO Opinion Bubble.
Outsized returns come from disruptions that expand an addressable market vs. simply¬†destroying the economics of an existing market
Product quality is proportional to the number of bitter arguments and threats of resignation that occur in the design process.
Let's not forget that Facebook's stock is actually up 80% YoY, putting it ahead of the vast majority of companies in the world.
If running your startup ever appears to be getting easier, you're probably not maximizing the opportunity.
Starting a company? Nearly a trillion dollars in market cap of enterprise players will be up for grabs as the world goes cloud.
New software development best practice: buying a company for a billion dollars to pressure your internal team to launch faster.
Startup success comes from betting against existing, flawed assumptions. The bigger the flaw the better.
My grandparents are going to love the Yahoo browser. Then again, they think the Internet is still a government research project.
Great company culture only comes when more people are giving to it than taking from it.
Sometimes we forget how long-term minded venture capitalists are. Then the stock market eagerly reminds us.
You'd think Wall Street is expecting MySpace to make a comeback.
Want the Facebook stock to go up?  Just start rabidly clicking anything marked "Sponsored" in your newsfeed.
The risk with public tech companies is we start to talk more about their stock price than their innovation.
Anyone who sells Facebook shares this week is basically saying they're against love.
Zuckerberg just got the High Score in "Life": marrying and IPOing within 48 hours.
30 years ago the government had the best technology. 20 years ago, enterprises. 10 years ago, consumers. Now it's 4-year-olds.
If you aren't saying "No" more than you're saying "Yes" as a startup, you're doing something wrong.
Microsoft netted $750M+ from Facebook's IPO. If that whole "Windows" thing doesn't end up working out, they'll make a great VC.
The reaction to Facebook's IPO today just proves we're all secretly crack addicts.
Now that Facebook has IPOed, what are we supposed to talk about on the Internet?
After I tried Facebook in '04, I thought, "This will be worth $3 million one day." I was actually just talking about its janitor.
I'm leaving out milk and a plate of cookies on Facebook IPO Eve just in case you end up with FB shares in the morning
Reminder: today marks the last day you can buy a house in the Valley without having to rob a bank or start Instagram.
Pinterest's $1.5B valuation confirms that you should never underestimate the power of kitten and wedding gown enthusiasts
Remember: there's an inverse relationship between great user experience and how much the user experiences.
Pretend that every hire you make will be your last. And see if that changes who you hire.
At some point we just have to trust that an indispensable service with a billion users, &amp; $1B in profit, will continue to monetize
Someone in Hollywood recently uttered the sentence, "It's Willy Wonka meets The Social Network but with iPods"
The cure for boredom is building your company around a vision that can never fully be realized.
Welcome to the storage industry Brad Garlinghouse! If you thought Yahoo was pure chaos, we take it to an all new level here
The #1 thing we can do to prevent a bubble is make sure the public markets aren't treated as a garbage disposal for the valley
That awkward moment when Groupon makes a profit on $559M in revenue, and thus all half-off jokes are ruined.
Future enterprise software leaders will build like Facebook, design like Square, measure like Zynga, and support like Zappos
Mom: you're my only investor that chose to take hugs instead of equity. You might not make a good VC, but you make a great mother
Yahoo: This is your last shot. No one knows what you are. Figure that out, and start aggressively building for the future.
What's the difference between a Yahoo CEO and a fruit fly?  Fruit flies are around longer.
To all the mothers of tech founders: despite the stress we cause you, thank you for always supporting us.
As the last weekend before Facebook is public, you should spend your time wisely. Also, consider stocking up on nonperishables.
Capitalism, at its core, is just the scientific process of converting anxiety into innovation
Looking forward to The Social Network's sequel, which chronicles the saga of Eduardo Saverin and the world's best tax advisors
The effective founder learns from their mistakes; the efficient one learns from everyone else's
If Microsoft builds a better search engine than Google, I will cease to be able to predict anything about this world.
I know you're as rare as leprechauns, but if you're an amazing designer then Box wants to hire you. Email recruiting@box.com
Someone should start a social network just for friends and family of Google employees. Oh wait, that's Google Plus.
I would marry Obama.
Yahoo CEO: No hoodie; AOL CEO: No hoodie; Facebook CEO: hoodie.  Coincidence?
After Facebook hit $1B in profits, you'd think investors would start demanding Zuck wear a hoodie.  http://t.co/n0jVngYC
Apple launches a new iPhone every year.  Facebook, a new design.  Yahoo, a CEO.
Glassdoor is going to have to invent a new kind of rating system just for Yahoo.
Something tells me there's not *that* much laughing...
The consequence of winning ludicrous patent suits won't be better protection of innovation, but rather the discouragement of itSo it turns out The Hunger Games was actually inspired by real events: being the CEO of Yahoo.
Rumor has it Zuck isn't wearing pajama pants to the IPO roadshow. Don't sell out to the man, yet!
Wow, the Avengers made $200,000,000 in a weekend. Looks like that Hollywood thing is still working out.
5 simple things America should 10X: math/science education, immigration, next-gen manufacturing, R&amp;D funding, startups
Amazon appears to be a $100B ongoing experiment in disruption. Its margins confirm as much.
Age is a deceptive metric when it comes to "young" tech entrepreneurs. Many have been building apps for the majority of their life
Let this Yahoo situation be a reminder: patent karma is a bitch.
Actually, it's an Oracle dream catcher; great article, though don't you feel like I look more stressed than Drew?
In other news, the market for authentic computer science degrees is up 50% today.
Then again, Yahoo's CEO *did* figure out a way to solve the computer science graduate crisis in the valley.
Wait, do I have to stop saying I got a PhD in quantum physics?
Box wants to be a 500 year company, which is why we diversified into nuclear energy and spice trading (in case of regression)
Evernote wants to build a company for 100 years. Leading me to believe the market crash of 2112 is going to be quite damaging.
Remember: Existence of a Problem != Existence of a Good Business Opportunity
I've been waiting 7 years for the cloud storage space to be as hot as check-ins, daily deals, and angry birds. The taste of glory.
My grandfather had the New Deal, my parents had the Moon Landing, I have Facebook IPO day.
The difference between a startup and a big company is you compete externally in the former, and internally in the latter.

Before selecting a major, all college students should be shown Zuckerberg's net worth. Then see what happens to CS popularity.
Every time someone says "bubble" an angel investor loses its wings.
Any market where the existence of a gatekeeper creates limited choice, and thus innovation, will be disrupted.
Tyler Winklevoss on being a VC: "We bring a little more than dollars to the table."  Like Lawyers!  http://t.co/JcMmv90M
If my algorithm is correct, Viddy is supposed to get acquired by Zuckerberg this weekend for $800M.
Whoever said "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery" probably hadn't worked in a tech startup.
I love Amazon's strategy, but it is fascinating that making $190M in a quarter (1/50th of Apple) is considered a "huge beat"
Haven't heard someone say "Google Drive" in at least 7 minutes; a clear sign that it's going nowhere.
If Yahoo launches a Drive tomorrow, I give up.
I'm pretty sure Apple has found a way to sell more phones than there are people in the world.
Some thoughts on Google Drive and avoiding an elephant attack: http://t.co/dVTVR5IB
It will eventually be a right of every internet user to have free and unlimited cloud storage space. That's why Box went enterprise.
Something is very wrong with a system that encourages Facebook to spend half a billion on legal protection rather than innovation
Facebook spends $550M for technology more than 2 years old. WTF is happening.
You know what's not cooler than a million dollars?  AOL's patents.
The depth of paranoia you will experience as an entrepreneur will rival even the greatest conspiracy theorists.
Something about being in New York just makes you feel like Jay-Z.  Until you remember you're here for a cloud platform event.

Splunk just had the most epic IPO ever, up 89% to $3B. Your move, Consumer Internet.
May 17th, Facebook's purported IPO date, is going to be like Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa all in one.

Ok, I'm getting schooled this week.  Need to acquire something.
The Harvard Business Case on Instagram is going to resemble something along the lines of Fan Fiction for capitalism.
Dammit. Today's tech news is back to being boring. Will someone take one for the team and sell at an astronomical valuation?
With Instagram's $1B acquisition, I can no longer recommend building enterprise software over photo sharing apps

Yahoo is decidedly in a no man's land where it's an underdog that doesn't have people rooting for a comeback story

Or the opposite of that!
Thanks for making BoxWorks amazing! I want to do it again next week, but supposedly &quot;annual conference&quot; has a better ring to it
I&#39;m happy to act as a reference for it&#39;s awesomeness. If you need a testimonial let me know.
Only when their opportunity is far worse...
Dammit.  That was the other half of the news man...
Oh snap.  Well that blows 1/2 of our news tomorrow.
Insane amount of cool stuff should come out of BoxWorks tomorrow.  Like literally lacking sanity.
I call BS.  :-)
Going to party like it's 5772 tomorrow night at BoxWorks (hebrew calendar joke).
 I haven't seen their numbers, but something tells me Tumblr isn't burning $687M a year to stay afloat.  :-)
It would appear only commerce co's have been 'truly enduring'. Maybe not surprisingly, content co's sell or die
Travel cos bought their users though :-) AFAIK. The list is dismally short. Sell, Fade, Die, or be Google.
Isn't a 'truly enduring' consumer internet business close enough to an oxymoron? In history we have like &lt; 5?
Don't worry. Enterprise software is as afraid of you as you are of it.  We'll be changing that this week. http://t.co/xuxT8GrF
With the CEO of Godfather&#39;s running for president, my interest in pizza is being validated at the highest levels of office
If only Myspace + KaZaA had a ticker: "650Balla listened to REAL_BritneySpears_Track_06.1_v2.mp3" credit
I think the currency may be in pesos...  Didn&#39;t confirm that though.
Yep agree with the premise just wanted to emphasize that it&#39;s not just speculative IPOs that get slammed :-)
If I get hit by a satellite in the few moments I'm outdoors this weekend, it will be very upsetting.
Hmmm. While I agree with the premise, all tech co's are speculative by your metric. See: YHOO, HP, NFLX, RVBD
seems like the making of a weird fetish site, GirlsWithTrophies.com
If my memory serves me, it was MashupCamp '06.  Btw, I didn't congratulate you on Assistly.  Congrats.
I swear I've changed.  You in SF by chance next week?  Third Eye Blind &gt; Snoop
Apparently not cool enough to be invited to secret Spotify party, so listening to Killers and Snoop on a Walkman out of spite.
Frizzy hair! ?  My hairdresser describes it as glorious...  Cool article!  Take that Microsoft! CC
Netflix is losing precious time/opportunity to use the "Who let the intern publish his crazy business idea to the blog?" excuse.
I'm all for not getting disrupted, but Netflix needed DVDs to segue into streaming. Otherwise it's alone in a dark alley with iTunes
There's a Qwikster and HP merger in there somewhere...
Blogging is jumping the shark right now.
Despite whatever rumors you may have heard, Box is not acquiring SharePoint. But, hey, for the right price...
Looking forward to a movie about Scrabble

IMO: 1. some people invest better, 2. succeeds begets success, and forces in habits that encourage cycle repetition
 and while that sounds much less profound, that's what I'm betting on :-).  #IsaidIwasTrolling
That was a lot of fun.  I knew you liked talking about enterprise software:  http://t.co/4jOmGaNU
sorry... you can't win w/out class. but I think winning ensures class over time, doesn't cause it. hence there's more
While you can't have wins without class, you can have class without wins. So there must be more to it  #ImATroll
Wonder when there will be a Disrupt award for "best new venture fund" launched. :-)
Microsoft used to announce new OSes to great fanfare.  Now they get slightly higher billing than iReport news on CNN.
Why anyone wants to start more companies that store your files is beyond me.  But welcome to the space!  :-)
Quick reminder to everyone at Disrupt this week: build companies, don't just launch them. Otherwise you're disrupting nothing
This one will usually suffice for me:  http://t.co/l5NNIXM
Ok that is for real.
Mac Air would have the same effect and be a lot safer...
this is all you :-)...  ahem
Hahaha I thought you really wanted me to see SF with you... and I was intrigued :-).
At this rate, Google must be planning to buy either Lycos or RCA next.
Watching this Yahoo mess, old media is saying, "now you know how it feels."  The internet can be a bitch.
 ideally no :-)
To any Yahoo employees left who want only a marginally less-chaotic working environment, come work at Box!
This whole technology industry just needs to calm the F. down for a sec. It's starting to look like Hollywood.  Go cloud!

Talking to driver about people talking to him about  This is meta.
Apple employees should probably just stop going to bars altogether.
Slightly less efficient than Microsoft I guess. They tend to win markets on the third try :-).
Hey and I were almost going a whole year without a Gdrive rumor. 7th time a charm you suppose for them?

I've been at this 6 years, and all it took is one Stevenote to make cloud storage hot. I'll get you next time, Jobs.
That strategy isn't in the Microsoft play book.  OK OK OK I'm done...
Totally, unfortunately Microsoft going aggressive-aggressive on this one wouldn't work out quite well :-).
To be fair, sometimes Apple sues instead of writing blog posts :-).  But either way, MS did lose on this one.
Looks like iCloud is Microsoft Live Mesh done right. And a better name. But as points out, we did have 5GB first.
Clouds are like air travel: Private is great in theory, but very few can actually do it, and it's way more bumpy.

A lot of enterprise startups don't build sales orgs fast enough, for instance, because selling over the web is more "efficient"
A lot of startups focus on efficiency at the cost of effectiveness.  Make sure you know when you're trading one for the other.
Waiting on Facebook IPO to reignite market is a huge farce. On the current course, there's limited upside for a retail investor IMO.

These YC kids have it so easy... back in my day, you could only pitch one angel investor at a time, and they'd still miss your meeting
Wow, congrats -- you lasted at Google even longer than I thought...
 Just started reading your book...  really great stuff!
good seeing you Saturday. Ping me if you're loitering on Cal Ave. ever. And let me know if you need a trending topic beta tester
Looks like there's nothing wrong with selling utility storage... 3PAR/Isilon now being valued at SaaS multiples.
Sup -- been a while, I believe :-).  I've been following Lookout a little, looks awesome.
In light of yesterday's groupon numbers, Box will be adding old navy coupons into its next product release.
  Fwded -- wasn't your gmail, my bad, yahoo!  Seems odd...
Well put. Btw, did you give anyone your Gmail credentials recently :-)?  I got some odd emails from your address last week...
Power of owning the graph - I hate to say it, but Facebook may be the first sustainably interesting LBS play
 New Digg looks very nice; why not allow for comments in-stream so people like me can troll more easily?
is on it. Real story here is Google Places attack and local advertising -- check-ins are just the crack to get there
I believe it's inevitable that every startup will pivot into a location-based group buying service...
 Great chatting today!  Hopefully I said something useful...
I refrain from using Foursquare because being mayor of your local Taco Bell has surprisingly limited upside.
Very disappointing loss for Box. I've taken care of the folks that were involved - see you at startup volleyball
When developing for the new enterprise, you necessarily have to sacrifice some potential users to maintain usability for the majority
In essence Sequoia/DFJ/etc become the "DAGs" of the super-angel world, with reduced risk/reward profile. And DST becomes your IPO
My Mom:  "OK, I won't tweet you, but if I want to tweet myself.  What do I do?"
I wouldn't put either past us.  We like to win.  However we do have some crazy french engineers...
Depends on who they were.  I can ask tomorrow...  If they look like this guy, then unlikey - http://bit.ly/avTX5l
 No can do. I play soccer like I use chatroulette. Awkwardly with occasional asthma attacks. Heard we did ok...
I do wonder if we're all turning building companies into too much of an academic exercise. More on this after I finish my MVP.
Sad when one of the most inspiring technical achievements I've seen in a year is a tweet with more than 140 characters.
Box movie trailer in my head: Dylan: "They uploaded 30 Gigabits of data in one day!!" // Me: "Gigabytes. 30 Gigabytes. It's like 8X more"
  that's the best product management of all :-)
The gap between good and bad product management is interpreting what the customer needs and just doing what the customer wants
In 1999 a 73GB drive called "Cheetah" was bleeding edge. When we started Box it was 500GB. It'll soon be 3TB. This is why cloud works now.
sort of like using twitter, right?  o_O
Fitting "inversely proportional" into a sentence is always a sure-fire way to look smart.  Ok, back to work.
K fine, I'm following. Better give us all your best tweets; no free account necessary.
 Wow, that's more badass than a Kanye tweet...  what are you drinking?
OH:  The firewall is dead, get over it.
Gmail needs a feature that prevents you from accidentally CCing Techcrunch on internal emails. I almost email weekly
 hahaha  ok fair, is rypple more suited for the task?
 Hard to hate apple for more than about 3 minutes, though :-).  Thank you for the patience/chatting.
 AHHHHH  Box 2.3 now showing up in my iTunes!  You seeing that, too?
Status on our end is "ready for sale," so at this point it's just a rollout deal on apple's end. I didn't invent this system :-(
 Hey David, that was our bad -- we were off by a day in our estimate of when everything would get approved. We're live now!
If I have kids, I'm going to manage them through SuccessFactors.
Box.net is hiring in Sales - tell your friends: http://bit.ly/acdMjX  (parts of this message are not endorsed by Box HR, just me).
It's awesome when candidates come to interview at Box in suits... What kind of operation do they think we're running here?
Rolling out major mobile-ECM updates this month - #cloudcontentFTW!  Thx http://bit.ly/c9ppYC http://bit.ly/caCAaC
I love reading about how epic Comdex was in the 80's/90's- feels like a magical tech carnival that could lead one to world domination
 sorry, I only have allegiance to / - just was doing recon  :-\
 Whaaaat?  Who charges?
 Ego and unfortunate trends... http://yhoo.it/b3Juai
Looking forward to reading Skype's S-1 tonight in the bath.  Could be very exciting for next wave of IPOs...
I've discovered that only my parents are commenting on my Facebook posts.  Moving exclusively to Twitter to feel more important.
I spoke with an ex-rancher today, and he said farming is actually very different from what you do in FarmVille. Ahhhaaa suckas.
I support a strong Work-Life balance, if by "life" you mean productive labor.
 Correct. SF is the only city where some gang allegiances are based on an interest in Yoga   RT http://twitpic.com/2cklx9
thanks for the confidence. Though, you've now jinxed my next 20 tweets - it will just be your taste that looks bad :-)
I heard that you wanted someone to speak on why enterprise software is coming back at Disrupt :-). Happy to help if you need
  It's a tweet meme.  Should I not participate?
#liesitoldmyparents Yes, of course Napster is legal. Tom Brokaw just doesn't understand computers.  (ok, ok I'm done, and a loser)
Yahoo, Inc. sends all their users C&D requests...  #liesitoldmyparents
That bill from Rackspace is to furnish my dorm room...  #liesitoldmyparents (omg I just participated in a twitter meme)
 that picture never stops amusing me. RT Everything is a bug. http://stackoverflow.com/posts/92060/revisions
The only thing you can rely on in the software business are the bugs.
Wave closing lost me a lot of credibility at Box - I'm like the guy in the 90s who wanted to bet the business on developing for WebTV
 That's actually never been confirmed, but touche. ;-)
"Office 2010 are declining, especially in the public and education sectors and in call centers" Always follow the call centers...
 but, you do like babies, right?
Ahhhh, just made me scared of approaching singularity. I just want to go back to the days of bloomberg terminals
 I'm hoping those goals are one and the same
Thanks for the post!  We all have some work to do to make ECM a little sexier :-)
 Great post, and great hanging out. Happy to be bursting out, as long as there are no bubbles...  :-)
Great, how about everyone just joins Google. Seriously, congrats say hi to and :-)
 if Eric Schmidt can chill the freak out, and you can stop doing such meta^3 analysis, I'll understand #TCMY  :-)
 I don't have a Ph.D; Should I plan on not understanding your tweets for the next few hours?
I was getting tired of having "What's our Google Wave Strategy" meetings end in tears. 
Wow! Gay marriage is unbanned and Google Wave is abandoned in the same hour. Total craziness for a valley collaboration company.
Waiting for someone to start an B2B-focused Groupon.  Group buying for servers/computers/supplies. Or maybe Gilt for Oracle/SAP products
- for a few seconds, it feels like fits into that photo.  Way to make sure everyone had their cool clothes on
 My motto: if the grass is green, then there's going to be pollen, so get back into the office and work instead of getting allergies
  Do you mind confusing everyone to try and slow down the process?  I'm with  - http://tcrn.ch/bzR1WC
-- that's not newsweek's datacenter, is it?
 Is outside of Starbucks on Cal Ave. Go pitch him, now!  (least-efficient form of foursquare, ever)
apparently this: http://bit.ly/b8Hv0J - also, have you ever published which hours you're not on Twitter?  :-)
What's the policy regarding derivative work and retweets? changed "you" to "u" and now it looks like a Jersey Shore tweet.
As far as I know, our mobile product manager is NOT moonlighting as a drug dealer...  https://www.box.net/shared/static/5bonedorte.jpg
Best way to build a company that keeps you excited: Find something you believe should be true in the world that isn't, and make it true
Long tradition of starting companies to get girls, not just Facebook;  Dell: girls dig cost-effective computers. Oracle: girls hated IBM DB2
 I'm with OS for drones sounds disruptive...  either that or go head to head against VoyURL.
$CRM S-1 ('04): "The success of our business depends on the continued growth and acceptance of the Internet as a business tool."
 that's more like why enterprise software is creepy...  :-)
Listening to Eminem while reading SaaS S-1s.  Feeling pretty gangster...
  No, sorry -- The only currency our board will go for is Flooz.
Waiting for the headline that says "Playdom acquired by Disney for $7.6B Facebook Credits"
 good seeing you last night -- glad we got to chat before the swearing part of the evening :-).
unfortunately the add probably filters out, not in, people who have ADHD
Funny how everyone in tech wants to kill print, yet we won't be as excited to say, "I'm on the homepage of flipboard, in some conditions!"
traditionally I've only followed people that have the word "cloud" in at least every other tweet. I'll make an exception for you
My task list includes "grow revenue, improve new product UI, add marketing page, and tweet something." The last one needs help...
 I heard you said hello to me, sweet.  Helllllooo!
 Hey Amanda -- What's up?  Can you shoot me a note, aaron@Box.net?
  Happy to sync up on definitions...  I could send you a URL or two to show you what I mean :-)
Would you rather have your software vendor take you to a golf tournament or save you $100,000 on IT?   #sexyenterprise
 Great seeing you last weekend -- glad we had the opportunity to discuss wireless data security :-).
If you tweet anything that is remotely salacious about enterprise software, please add #sexyenterprise.  Trying to start a meme here.
 I think caused a bit of competitiveness to come out of me...  It might just be that I'm intimidated by his upper chest.
 Wisdom:  Resumes submitted by candidates at 3AM on Saturday are worse than any other time.
 yeah usually never good news following that opening :-)...  though better you to say it than them
-- Ahhh, ok. Yes, traditional enterprise software can only cause and elicit painful memories. Naturally, we're trying to change that
  hahaha Why?
I've found that having a girlfriend is more expensive because she'll actually accept the drinks I offer to buy her...
techcrunch's continued portrayal of timberlake and eisenberg as facebook's founders is going to really start screwing with my head :-)
"Tesla Launches New Website"  Stock up 7%.  I guess you have to trade on some news...
Looking to hire the 3rd best designer on the internet (we already have the 1st and 2nd best)...   ping me if you know anyone.
I really don't mean to be cynical (or obvious), but this group buying and flash deal stuff is a bubble http://tcrn.ch/a15Mm9
Well, at least Microsoft has an Art collection... http://www.microsoft.com/about/artcollection/en/us/default.aspx
Facebook Gifts are closing?  This will force me to acknowledge birthdays, weddings, mother's day, and mistakes I've made with actual effort.
 I repeat that line daily
 what! you guys want relevant industry commentary?  I really don't understand how to use twitter.. will try again
just got back from the dentist...  who knew you were supposed to floss regularly!
  yep thx, got confused by the similarity of the acronyms (as in, exact same :-)). This does look cool, though.
  will this be out of IIG?
Why are people going on vacation and not working. Capitalism = Freedom.  Celebrate with work. That is all. #july4
"...excitement waned as investors began to consider [Tesla's] current performance."  #publicmarketsarefunny
so glad US is out of the world cup.  Box HQ is way more productive!
Looks like my twitter account got hacked - wish I could get hooked up with any of the revenue that was made from the link "I" tweeted
gnarly  http://siteanalytics.compete.com/bebo.com
 Awesome!  Can I put you in touch with someone here :-)?
  hook it up?  http://www.techmeme.com/100610/p18#a100610p18
 same here.  don't steal our news today...  great new homepage, though.  freaking sweet looking.
 ahhh, I remember those years :-)
If you're into part-fish-part-eagle-women that kill people and then turn into men, go see splice!  (otherwise, don't)
Great post and points on ECM vision/future by -- http://bit.ly/bhkYWS  - still no CCM love :-)
 sup?
 are you giving away our whole strategy :-)?
I'm long on HTML5. http://bit.ly/cdKB44
-- I think it'll point to: use whatever dis/integration strategy makes the better "product".  anyway, goog is new msft.
I love that Microsoft pushes Silverlight to the detriment of their marketing materials - learning about their ERP requires a download
  hey yo, you coming tomorrow?
www.altitude2010.com is tomorrow. Should be awesome! We have room for a couple more folks - if you're interested email anthony@box.net
what do people not understand about the web that they're still writing about Diaspora?
- I feel like Myspace is a few million phishing attacks and pedophilic users too late to be the "safe, secure social network"
I finally realized why I don't get foursquare.  I don't go anywhere.
 - great working with you guys, thanks!  hope I didn't bring the team down with my disgusting hair.
Awesome new cloud campaign (possibly a little anti-microsoft, I can't tell):  www.ichoosethecloud.com  #choosecloud
too soon, agreed.
"I think you are out of this world."  - Well thanks, unsolicited email.
 I feel like your ipad should be out, and your kindle should be in a case...
