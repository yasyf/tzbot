some of the best angel investments are consensus (ie, not contrarian) but maybe not risk-adjusted because valuations are higher
+1 it's more competitive now but those cos had a then-unprecedented number of seed funds, angels to choose from
enterprise companies not necessarily black swan imho. if you can see ur target market at seed, then it's not really random
great point. i don't know...but there was not a 'rush' to get into these companies IIRC

3/ in 2007 by creating a generation of mobile-first founders via the iPhone/iOS but it is close
2/ ...for software-first founders. You don't need a MD or PhD in biology to create/capture value. Maybe not as seminal as what Apple did..
1/ Apple's ResearchKit is most promising thing in health software in awhile. This and 'Obamacare' creating more opportunities ...
