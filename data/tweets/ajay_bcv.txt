luck is averaging 4 a season and Brady less than 3.  Plus luck never benefited from having video tapes of the opponents practices.

Amazon/bezos are maniacally focused on their customers.  The fact that Xmas orders were late is a problem they won't tolerate.
Oh no!
Amazon's relentless march continues.   http://t.co/oG7UIs2EM9
goods were in wrong warehouses on otherside of country. If in correct zone, plenty of trucks to get then to homes in time for Xmas
the big spike is yoy Ecomm growth. 12/24 vs last week is smaller spike...likely &lt;10 %.  As you point out, bottleneck was air
they need trucks for grocery anyway.  And they will rely on usps for excess demand.  They will never be able to fulfill 100%
If the goods were in the right warehouses near the eventual customers, the reliance on next day air would have been mitigated.
drones are pipedream.  Won't see them for decade or more.  Amazon will use their grocery trucks to reduce dependency on UPS.
actually I don't think "last mile" is the biggest problem.  Software and warehouse backbone was not designed for ecommerce
The retail supply chain and logistics infrastructure of the US has not kept up with ecommerce growth. UPS problems are tip of iceberg.
Yes , perhaps.  But allows Amzn to control entire customer experience.  Plus they already have trucks for grocery delivery.
UPS debacle this Christmas is further incentive for amazon to have their own trucks delivering packages.
