then I guess the pats have been an under .500 team the last few years.
Luck is unbelievable.
Colts got 2 instead of 3 or 7.  Pats were lucky kicker fumbled the ball.
They'd have 1st and goal shooting for 7 points instead of getting 2 points.
Colts would have been better off if they tackled the kicker at the 1 yard line.  Dierdorf is mistaken.
That score won't change outcome of game but certainly affected lots of folks in Vegas.

luck is averaging 4 a season and Brady less than 3.  Plus luck never benefited from having video tapes of the opponents practices.
I would take Luck in the 4th quarter over any other active QB in the league.
Luck looks ridiculous with a beard.
are these big 12 refs or big 10 refs?
happy new year to you.  Have fun today in pasedena. Go Stanford!
Amazon/bezos are maniacally focused on their customers.  The fact that Xmas orders were late is a problem they won't tolerate.
Oh no!
Amazon's relentless march continues.   http://t.co/oG7UIs2EM9
goods were in wrong warehouses on otherside of country. If in correct zone, plenty of trucks to get then to homes in time for Xmas
the big spike is yoy Ecomm growth. 12/24 vs last week is smaller spike...likely &lt;10 %.  As you point out, bottleneck was air
they need trucks for grocery anyway.  And they will rely on usps for excess demand.  They will never be able to fulfill 100%
If the goods were in the right warehouses near the eventual customers, the reliance on next day air would have been mitigated.
drones are pipedream.  Won't see them for decade or more.  Amazon will use their grocery trucks to reduce dependency on UPS.
actually I don't think "last mile" is the biggest problem.  Software and warehouse backbone was not designed for ecommerce
The retail supply chain and logistics infrastructure of the US has not kept up with ecommerce growth. UPS problems are tip of iceberg.
Yes , perhaps.  But allows Amzn to control entire customer experience.  Plus they already have trucks for grocery delivery.
UPS debacle this Christmas is further incentive for amazon to have their own trucks delivering packages.

excited you're here!
Congrats to Jeff glass, and  http://t.co/P42RAtsb
the Ryan brothers are both overrated.
Steelers win it!  Huge come back!
Huge play by Harrison!
wow!  Beautiful.
thank god the Afc is so bad this year.  I think 9-7 gets us in.
The Steelers without Big Ben are a mediocre team. #steelers.
Stanford is the hottest team in college football. Too bad there isn't a playoff.
If we had beaten notre dame, Stanford would be ranked 2 in the country.
Biggest win in Stanford football history!
That was big!
agreed.
We're in 4 down territory here.
Wow!
definitely. We can't play conservative like we did last year.

 he beat you?  okay, that seals it!
you're right on Novak, my bad.  I think Agassi deserves to be in top 5 with the big three and sampras.
 they are trying to keep a low key profile this year.
im sick of your red sox bashing tweets :-)
Agassi was first modern man to win all four grand slams. Sampras, McEnroe, and Borg didn't do it but Nadal, federer, and Novak all did.
Tough time to be Andy Murray.  Any other era and he'd have won at least one grand slam. #wimbledonfinal
A friend made a convincing argument that rafa, roger, and novak are all in the top 5 all time.  #wimbledonfinal
