how I assess whether to follow: who do I follow that follows them, twitter bio, follower:following ratio, last 20 tweets
i make this point bc I still got opportunities even w/o going to college, but lots of luck involved obv
would you have hired blake if he didn't have good grades? :P they prob valued you cause you're smart
agreed. not essential if not aiming to do more school is what i meant!
no not everyone knows that grades aren't essential in tech
i was like wait a minute. 1) you use FB everyday. 2) IBM is still alive???
this is really random but a college friend said recently: FB is gonna die, just like how IBM died
+1. figure out what you're good at and double down on it, but gotta sacrifice things (grades, etc) to do so
this is so funny hahaha
but of course
hahahahaha where did you even find this
snap discover has gone from decent to absolute trash over the last year.
"end of society stimulator" happy indeed. just prepping myself for this year, brb
agreed. how does this apply to patreon?
coming from someone who uses the winky face emoticon in every sentence...this is a surprising statement 😮🤔
can you elaborate more on this?
woohoo! grats dude! 🚀
wow
what a time to be alive
i can help with that! 😛
this is so gross
yep!
thats what i already do https://t.co/lMRPSqQSdA

literally goals
DM me if interested
not something that can be averaged. I just do it when I find that they bring more stress/negativity to my life than happiness 🙋🏻
u hacker u
Most people are super self conscious about their voice or photos of themselves...make it fun and less stressful for them
stemmed from a fun convo w $$ opportunity here.
DM if you're a designer and want to learn more :)
Audio filters = undervalued. Haven't heard anyone talk about this. Ppl use Snap filters bc they make u sound/look cuter or funnier.
💡 Filters are crucial in making your users feel comfortable for any visual content driven social network – photos, videos, audio.
hey sorry! fixing right now. in the meantime, can sign up here :) https://t.co/ELvQwg0rHs

best part of my week. soundcloud discover is improving lots too
so awful. happy called founders out on this tho https://t.co/dt9GNR36nC
I say VCs
ya step 1. use a real photo of yourself as your profile picture :P
sorry this is impossible on twitter
hahaha too real
this is fantastic 🙌 thanks for compiling!
yeahhh, just noticed this today too. at first glance, i think it looks much cleaner/better than before
wow can't get any more tech trash kyle hahah you wearing allbirds too? ;)
omg wonder how much this cost
would be an interesting story!
yeah I ask myself a similar Q whenever i'm doing anything: "why am I spending my time on this?"
not something I can definitively answer without conducting a survey!
anything is possible with 💰

and sometimes the people who know you deeply support you the least and then you realize they're #fakefriends 😳
yeah brands have a hard time understanding tumblr since you can't understand unless you're deeply immersed in the platform
completely different world than normal social networks (snap/ig/twitter) and how users behave on them
the content &amp; trends on there, esp memes https://t.co/dEcdM6MwTK
Tumblr is such a unique and bizarre world that's hard to understand, but kids are still using it &amp; talking… https://t.co/Y4EW1uLTwW
Just found these on Tumblr...forgot how creative and artistic the content on Tumblr is 😍 https://t.co/LekAZCo6HN
this is why i take notes all the time to flesh out thoughts and then try to condense into tweets
best thing i got from twitter = thinking concisely and in 140 characters...or could be a bad thing as well 😅
yes. this. understated.
kids should be happy that their friends want to get lunch with them right?
could say the same thing about DTL but check out all the negative sentiment on twtr?
add means add. invite = invite. rly weird world we live in if add now means invite
https://t.co/Nm8z11wz9G
that's a design problem - you can make it seem like it's sent. unless you're thinking about it from snap pov re: hosting
i think kids still appreciate saving memories/photos
i guess but it also depends on the situation. sometimes you'd like to preserve in-the-moment snaps (and wish they were HQ)
Yeah I guess looks reasonable on phone, but this might just be bc I'm thinking about this from a photographer's perspective 😛
I just took 2 photos: Snap was 161 KB and low res. iPhone was 1.9 MB and incredibly sharp.
might as well retire from twitter
are you too cool to follow anyone now? 🤔
oh yeah, fb def won big time on that one
in terms of advertising? depends on what you're trying to sell
it's funny that snap calls itself a camera company but photos are incredibly low quality
he's also prob asking his secret kid friends about it rn
scared to even download it
nooooooo, someone stop this now
this is really awesome, love what you're going to be focusing on! 🙌
ya DAU is definitely a more important metric for social networks
what app tho
👻 vs 📷

Snapchat = 160m DAU 

Instagram Stories = 150m DAU
Instagram = 400m DAU 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
omfg 😍
googled it and copied/pasted it
I'm just used to seeing/clicking the default camera icon! https://t.co/dxeRth0DwR

i thought this was a given, no?
you mean gen z teaches you about millennial terms you're supposed to know? 👶🏻
I wholeheartedly agree w you josh (sorry sarahhh)
no go to sleep
what's this mean exactly?
yeah I think I will! engagement on tweets works as a good litmus test on whether the topic is interesting
no point in wasting people's time when you can condense your message into 1 tweet

ugh was kidding #retiredandrecoveringVC
demps what are 3-5 early stage companies you're looking at right now that i should invest in??
you as well!
so excited for this - much needed
i dont think so, moved from sf to la to pursue YT career (iirc) – prob bc most big YTers are there so easier to collab
twitter prob heard the crunches
yeah honestly haven't found a great solution yet. also suggested hiring an upworker to help maintain every week

he's lying!!!
wat
yeah but gotta mean what you say or else don't say it imo
ya forsure!
another thought: it also becomes a driving factor behind why many kids want to be a "founder" – for the press, fame, 30u30 😐
yikes 🙁
wow that's optimistic 😬
every VC at end of meeting: 
"let me know if I can help you in any way!"

me when I saw that DGross became a YC partner at 25...and proceeded to ask myself what am I doing with my life
❤️❤️❤️
yeah same honestly. I want to be good in whatever space I'm working in, not just "good for my age"
starts whenever you start seeing headlines about child prodigies I would think
wait what! prob one of the few successful high school dropouts 😬
omg
Esp stuff like 30u30 😛
Tech press has put weird pressure for kids to achieve lots as young as possible...which I don't think is healthy for most
I feel like I'm in a race against time and idek why. Majority of really successful entrepreneurs started later in their lives
21 year old just texted me this #kidsthesedays #relatable https://t.co/FdjbvSZX4P
yeah sure 🙄🙄🙄
stop spreading fake news Simon go away
ya I think this is less of a "controversial comment" and more of a "conspiracy theory" lol sry Burns
what
hopefully! I like their food
don't have exact #s &amp; I could be completely wrong but I feel like rev share w restaurants is way more sustainable than in-house
I don't think value prop is big enough to convert users (maybe SF/LA but not really beyond that) but I do agree on delivery time
yeah I like Sprig's food more tbh but UberEats has more choices and just clearly a higher chance of survival

do it for the viral tweet

Pokemon Go, duh. (no it's a presentation remote/clicker)
no more YT videos for Blake 😂
❤️ this! (also "city of monoculture" is a great phrase to describe sf)
get asked a lot about how I got started &amp; suggestions for young people looking to get into tech so usually talk about these 2
haha i don't know spanish - i typed the photo caption in google translate and that's what came out??

my advice:
1. say yes to most speaking engagements
2. start small

my first talk was to &lt;50 people and then ramped up
going to be pretty busy next year but open to it! DM me :)
p.s. that translates to "Twitter changed my life" – common topic in most of my talks 😂
Reflecting on 2016 and realized I conquered my biggest fear: public speaking 🤗

Spoke in Ireland, Spain, 4 schools,… https://t.co/3PSP5XuIwK

isn't there research that shows if you publicly post your resolutions, you're less likely to stay accountable

i wonder why hotel sites do this
howd it go
yikes. thanks for heads up 😳
yep! gave me that advice for taking notes/making guides 😬
used to keep list: "Today I learned" but that quickly split up into individual notes
I don't really. trying to figure out a good org system - suggestions wanted 🙏
Apple Notes hahah. and then I share screenshots/summaries with friends via text
twitter = good curation but gets lost in the noise + lots of news (vs. timeless content)
curation (by friends &amp; ppl I respect) + synthesis + commentary is what I care about the most
really wanted to build a platform like "twttr for tweetshots" / people only share best content
kinda like linkydink?
how do you imagine this looking? thought about this quite a bit bc twitter = too much noise

I like Messenger but iMessage is just way faster for me. Will check out simplenote again!
tried SimpleNote, Evernote/Alternote, Letterspace, and a bunch of others a long time ago. might switch back to Letterspace again. you?
Apple Notes and iMessage (awful search)

not at you! i meant at twitter :(
why wouldn't Apple just build that into FaceTime
iMessage = asynchronous communication and it's text. HP is sync video
ugh the young.

agreed. what other skills do you think are going to be important?
live by this but also the fact that there's something to be learned from everyone 🙏
lots of luck, as well as being nice and helpful to people :) story will hopefully come out sometime in the next few months!
so true 🙈
just a mindset! also because I spent a ~1.5yr completely immersed in the scene
I used to think they held the 🔑 to everything. Little did I know!
In a decade ;)
2 yrs ago, I was terrified of talking to VCs, pitching them, etc.

Oh how things have changed. Now I see them just like I see anyone else. 😬
hahah amazing. can they acquire The Hush? 😝

wait how did you get your M icon to show up on the top left #need

@jakepaul is this brodie omg
step 1: throw phone in trash can
tbh I think Messenger is going to win this space (and is already beginning to take over) bc platform agnostic
neither is iMessage!
bc I'm sure Facetime is going to eventually have this feature built-in
hate to be a downer but...there's no way apple doesn't shut this down within the next few months

seeing if they actually produce results?

are you saying...people don't actually care about VCs???? someone tell all the VCs that!
if I don't get an inmail I'm gonna be so offended

why do you need to make fake accounts?
loop me in too! :)
I think a big part is being super observant of your behavior and causes and results of it
would ruin the app + scare/push away more than half their users, I bet
at...some...point
and I really want to make this
LOL nice bunk beds!!!
nah more like $33m
i just discovered this today through 😍
now would be a good time
great setup
I think it's lack of resources and/or time

APPARENTLY ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

they have audio/voice transcription!
💯 solid work pumping out a bunch of great blog posts recently
you're biased ;) but I generally agree. Snap exec told me they don't rly care about celebs - want it to be a place for friends

pls keep adding more communication platforms!

omfg.
wait but that's my job
THE OLDS ARE ARRIVING IN FORCE!!!!!! ahhhh
lol I don't use snapchat for advice. I use it to send photos/videos to friends. barely watch stories too.
no never 😰 😭
RUN. RUN FAR AWAY.
ugh. look at what you guys have done https://t.co/lqIXmguBPi https://t.co/9ebw6eN8b1

you don't understand how excited I am to listen to this
nice cameo 🙋🏻
not enough people in the valley call things/people out 🙄 appreciative of those that do. too much fluffy hype.
why does the DMV still exist

:( not safe to drive when sick either tho. i say just hire a chauffeur 😜

why are you buying a car?!?
tabs vs spaces
dat composition tho 👌
not talking about IQ in the context of IQ tests
you can learn though? and that's how you increase your IQ
I'm not quite sure which is why I wanted to ask the public but I think EQ might be harder since it's more of a soft skill
really? how do you know (that they had a low EQ and that they have a high EQ now)?
oooh good point
🤔 interesting results - 

220 think it's harder to get EQ.
173 think it's harder to get IQ. https://t.co/VprcjI1NTk
yesssss. there's a difference btwn hustling and being overly aggressive -- the best founders are self-aware enough to realize.
yeah I've set it up so it messages me every morning at 6am with the weather and a motivational quote
"I'm Stewart and I'm really good at snapchat"
lol and it's not even a bot - it's all manual 😂
I think just assistant. but I love M.
people still use Magic?
really? I've had good experiences w UberEats
hi 👯
yeah SOUNDS. did that too 😐
Munchery's having a tough time https://t.co/Ex7rGTsHRa https://t.co/ji1o2656qb
deeplinking voice basically. and products like Instagram can't even implement deeplink on iOS smh
v v dope. they've built some cool tech into a consumer product 😎
Always amused when I see people still using Hotmail
hahaha attention spans man...
I want to learn more
thinking about what's a good way to assess intelligence besides IQ tests
yep. bc growth mindset. people change as they grow up - some more than others based on ambition, work ethic, etc.
it's like how people used to treat design (vs code)! but designers are getting more and more respected ❤️
they aren't!! but pretending they are in this case
didn't mean IQ tests but moreso whether it's hard for geniuses to socialize or social people to learn hard technical subjects
because the valley puts hard tech on a pedestal, when people are just as important.
hmm. I think EQ can get worse as well.
yes. my bad on the order of my example. but basically "IQ" = IQ is harder to develop (presuming you have EQ)
What do you think is harder to develop? 

(e.g. 
👩 has IQ and wants to develop EQ 
vs.
she has EQ and wants to develop IQ)
unreal.
😂
focusing on the people/users is so undervalued
u next?
yeah similar experience - classmate from canada thought i was from china. i was like i'm more american than you...🙄
sup guys 🤗
cause school &amp; all these hills 😂🏃
so punny
congrats 👊
yes!!! this is why I love platforms like Twitter which connects people (esp those that prefer being behind a screen than IRL)
makes sense. just learned about egoistic suicide (suicide bc of insufficient social integration)
'grats!
what'd u use pls share
loooooool
did you manually count this........
ugh you've outed me, Stebs. she is so gonna know which Q I asked 😬
and in like, anything

super good. love this 👏
plus, going so far as to using the same name is plain dirty. Teleparty's domain used to be https://t.co/vnw2Qfrr3U 🤔
so essentially, barrier to entry is way higher than before since there's so much noise in the app store?
why?
Yes and 1) Stories baked into core product, not a whole new product 2) Systrom owned up to it 3) Added own twist to it
99% sure it's not an acquisition. Aakash works at WeWork now.
there's shame in copying a product entirely.
lol
this is spectacular! also def belongs on the community builder list :)
ah okay that makes sense!
I have some friends in China who still use IG but maybe got over firewall? Regardless, they're still aware of the app
this isn't to say that I don't love Snapchat - I do and I use it way more than I use IG. but this is def something to keep in mind.
I'll finish this year for you
shhh don't tell the 'rents that 🤐
brb building jetpack
😧 you can scrape public history though? likes and RTs
Friend from Russia told me he gets 4x views on IG than SC bc his friends use IG and have never even heard of SC.
Reminder: Instagram Stories is used internationally whereas Snapchat isn't and is even blocked in some countries like China.

wrote something very similar to this a long time ago! check out his eBook of old blog posts
side note i'd like to point out - devs aren't the only ones behind an app #takesavillage
consumer attention is not full 🤗 or else why would teens check fb/insta/snap every hour to see if anything new has popped up
prob knows some cool people there?
i want in on this too

hi benny 😛 (thanks Sam!)
the way you word and deliver feedback is crucial but nuanced and a hard skill to build, imho
why is it tough? because you don't want to hurt people's feelings if you're being skeptical but frank? or?

I'm still a bot what are you talking about
v useful 🙌
yep! meet
🙋🏻
yeah but Snapchat owns Bitmoji so makes sense to integrate their content/app. haven't allowed 3rd party yet.
please stay safe, Bo!!! 😨  it's just a game!
pretty sure he's just cementing his title as world's best troll ever.
key word is "gracefully" here

That sad feeling when you mess up your original tweet but can't delete bc getting engagement already 😵😪

Meant to say &gt;$1.5m!!
yeah and I dont consider being able to use those services = programmer :P
LOVE IT! and vice versa I'd think :)
agreed. but I don't think 1b ppl need to be programmers. I suppose it depends on your definition of "programmer."
but do we really need 1b programmers? do you think everyone's going to become a coder?

Hahaha. What a sad world we live in where we are default-indoors/on some sort of technology. 🏃
they're also not wealthy; they're just insta-famous and travel for free through sponsors
you're right. probably wrong choice of words. more like aspirational? a ton of kids look up to these 2
yeah it's awesome. plus the people they chose for the promo video (jay &amp; alexis) was perfect for relatability
sells these custom hats lol
I think their reasoning behind the regional roll-out is so their servers don't crash?

just personal preference bc I will name notes like "Binary - to-do" "Binary - meeting notes" etc.

I think of venture = network/access + assessment/picking

Keep the DMs coming :)
LOL
just do it #yolo
sorry! I need to make a website for it. https://t.co/X0Gf1NgE7u

yep. was the only investor who told them not to sell. twitch was completely undervalued.
go 👊
prob to show that they have their own conviction around investments / don't depend on or wait for other investors
all about that UGC
nope, not urgent
you really don't need push for it. the only things I have push on for are iMessage, Outlook, Messenger, and Snapchat.
just personally, I don't have FB push on but still constantly check
sorry I meant who uses FB as daily social network anymore? 😛 (not many kids!)
everyone's on it but not everyone's active
who uses Facebook anymore
over/under on using this feature per day for his old tweets? 😉🤔
that's actually amazing. this is the worst part about concerts.
psh this is already v TLDR
whaaaat! 😀🙈

oh no. bringing this back?!
are you kidding me right now

long feedback loop though so can't depend on a winning investment to build network.
absolutely 🙌
yeah need to account for both quantity &amp; quality of each individual in your network
yes completely agree
how many people would vouch for you is a good way to figure out strength and depth of friendships/network
imo need both to be a good VC 😉

Went to my friend's place and saw these types of questions all over the wall

#justSFthings https://t.co/Hq2I9T99fN
just bring your camera everywhere and take a lot of photos
not necessarily.
yeah. then why'd you said they only work *for now*?
Yup. Was just about to name those examples.
Josh is saying that Messenger works rn bc it's not overloaded yet (unlike email). But I think even so, users will stay.
Messenger - M, talking to brands, ordering Ubers, etc
bundle up everything, like how FB is trying to add all sorts of features into core app + Messenger.
so you think companies will keep trying to be all-in-one &amp; then users will hop once that happens?
Shows aren't just about "other people's successes." For ex, you can learn a lot about agencies/ent/Hollywood from Entourage
went to go download this app... realized it's already on my phone 😳
mindset*
Definitely a good amount. I find myself still going to default camera first though bc higher quality
"millennials have had to invent coping mechanisms for working alongside their elders" 😂😂😂
which not many people have the luxury of doing.
wouldn't say it's 0. detracts you from your current task UNLESS you are actively listening/discovering music
you hip, you hip.
Been thinking about this for a long time, as well as how to make music more social.
haha I want to be a tropical house DJ!!!
favorites are soundcloud, spotify discover weekly, and hype machine
do you listen to new music? I got my boss (39) to start listening to tropical house music so...😛
it's just about always being in a growth mindset

that's the exact article I was about to look for to share here haha

yeah, incredibly hard for them to figure out how to optimize this but if they can...then they win 👌
that's why I only said on demand food delivery :)

Uber already has all these drivers on the road transporting people. They just need to factor in food delivery now too.

Avenir is one of my favorite fonts :)
Changed to Avenir.
I highly, highly respect designers :)I would think the same? IMO designers are just as important as engineers and should be paid as such.
For some products (esp. consumer social), they should be able to sell itself.
Or founders who care about good design &lt;3
Easy to gauge how much a company values design based on comparing its designer to engineer salaries on Angel List.
Avenir! Me too.

Digg gave you that much traffic??
actually? I think people who get hit up a lot are less likely to reply if you ask them publicly (bc then others will too)
Even worse for photographers when people ask about what equipment you use.

It's alright. Sometime works. Doesn't work well for setting up a meeting for 2+ people though

Do you guys also integrate w social media??
Any way to triage your messages on Twitter and Facebook (maybe Chrome ext)? I've been having an increasingly hard time managing them 😞
Oooh good call. I haven't used that in a long time. Thanks for the suggestion!

NO. Tried that for a bit. Nicely designed but terrible note-taking app.

yeah it was bad... but you're a journalist! makes sense that you're organized haha 😁
lol no, my inbox was just emails on emails without labels prior to this!
you've never emailed me! now I need a similar workflow for messages on social networks lol
Also I deeply apologize to everyone who I've neglected over email. This will hopefully happen less because of this new workflow. 💯🤓
If you're drowning in email, implement amazing workflow ASAP:

I think it's Zuck's dog's younger sibling
I just connect with FB
Yup. Vain accolade.
it's because the press coddles teens/young entrepreneurs too much.
it's so sad when that happens. has made me more cautious about setting up and using new note-taking products.
It's always awesome when a popular product is about to shut down and someone decides to personally take it over. https://t.co/mcsRaPy1qG

yup basically! 

"Hey I know you from Product Hunt!"
"😳"
hahah this has happened to me in SF too!
voice much more different than text or photos
I said depends 😉
you're completely right. meant UI isn't that ugly!
omg good onboarding idea: have an embarrassing example so people feel less self conscious 😂
It's the fact that they force people to record something to move on though. People are self conscious.
I had the app downloaded for months &amp; couldn't get myself to finish the onboarding cause I really didn't want to record
too much friction in their onboarding flow honestly. design's not bad though.
thanks Daniel! :) know what you're going to hack on tomorrow yet?
thanks alex!! appreciate the kind words
kids are good
thanks 😊 you guys are awesome
thanks Joel!!

Yup the GS one was well done! And I meant to say *interactive* bite sized content so infographics don't count.

yup! not a new phenomena forsure. was just pointing it out.
It's funny how tech people have polarized the world into 2 types: 
techies &amp; non-techies. 

e.g., "non-techies are actually on this app!"
social apps*
I'd argue most social networks are popularity contests to a certain extent! but don't think that's the point of Stolen
yup but bc people are intrinsically competitive, they start fighting over stealing/owning certain friends

Peeple is about actually rating and reviewing people. Stolen is a fun game.
💡What if Stolen added a review feature a-la-Peeple?!
oops

no. I'm saying for WoM on social products, teens are still &gt; adults.
but how many adults will text 20 friends about a hot new social app they're on vs kids at school?
oh yeah completely agree. sorry for not clarifying earlier! I was referring to social products only
a bunch of social apps gained momentum through teens sharing IRL (snapchat, fb, vine, etc)
true but teens also spur the fastest word of mouth growth though.
but why would companies ever want to add that on top of their platform? they *want* users addicted
huge philosophical q but I say no. it's up to people how they use the platforms made available to them. there can be AA for tech tho!

just didn't know people were still using google groups! seems to me like more people are using Slack for the same use cases
ah true. professional vs personal is a good point
wow I agree. terrible experience on phone.
It's going to be sooooo fantastic once we can start buying from stores through Messenger
you use google groups?
this is v useful
elaborate?
ew. I wonder why they use LI for distribution
oh yeah, forgot about them. I know, like, 2 people who blog on LinkedIn. Basically used as content marketing platform
Depends on what I'm writing about. Medium is still mostly tech &amp; "life advice." But until FB adds viral mechanism, prob still Medium
you probably would soon if everyone moves there though
Will only 1 win? Or can there be multiple winners?
For the record, I think FB is going to win. Medium doesn't have consumer lock-in &amp; their "follower/following" is pointless.
But I think FB will win, since they can add Medium's public-recommendation-virality feature pretty easily.
just bc they're focused on 1 thing doesn't mean they'll win. I'm in btwn FB and Medium. Both have different types of distribution
you think Medium will win in the long run? why's that
haha yeah, still think they're using it.
time to build something that will autopost to all!
don't think it's necessary for them to work on that yet since slack is still very much team focused
hi kyle! How is life
oh yeah I'm all for blogging!! thought you meant you're excited that blog posts are gonna be more fragmented now
I don't really consider that blogging per se since it's still internal right?
not gonna get tired of all the cross posting??
really? why?
would to love to hear your guys' opinions since both are prominent bloggers. still gonna stay on Medium?
Ha yeah it'd be tiring to have to cross post everywhere
So is everyone trying to jump into blogging now? 

FB just launched Notes.
Medium got more funding.

haha was just curious on why Sam doesn't agree! But really these are just semantics in the end.
Didn't suggest startups to pitch themselves as "the x for y" in order for it to stick in investors' minds?
how many more plot ideas can they drum up...I mean, they were already getting repetitive to be honest.
glad you're safe bud!
killer photo
agree completely
no doubt everyone aims to be accurate but need speed to keep testing to see if you're accurate
beautiful.
that legit made me laugh hahahah
But also, I think teens say something one way, and act the other. Gotta keep that in mind.
I just took both negatives out ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
nah, that's a fist bump!

no way!!! I was gonna go there. went to Hopkins middle school
which HS?! I was raised there, then went to HS in South Bay, now SF 😛
what have you gathered from your research? :)
you troll 😂👏
oh word! I'll try to make that!

But I do wish there were a more aggregated contacts platform since LI blows. Maybe some sort of personal CRM.

can't access App Store in China :( this is what I see http://t.co/qluQ0XDVET
not sure if just me or if everyone bc of the breach but the App Store here hasn't been working these past few days

SLJ, &amp; I are on to you.
hmmmm 500px maybe?
are you talking to yourself Greg
ah so you use it as both a bookmarking &amp; read later tool.
&amp; how does one get on beta? honestly just want ability to highlight
interesting usage. How often do you go back and search for something you've read a long time ago?
psh you can use that "I'm from France" excuse for anything 😜
use Alternote on Mac
haha I used to use SimpleNote! wasn't powerful enough for me
wait what happened?! I'd be dead if I lost my notes
omg

O 
ty for pro tip
no I'm happy
hard when you don't have mutual friends! also many letters to type vs 4 numbers
guess I got lucky then. I imagine they'd be pushing this out to the public soon!
it's not a face! so no worries 😜
Brilliant new feature by Facebook. 
Comes in real handy for parties and events. http://t.co/euE8fBly1D
I take this back. My friends and I have been sharing photos through DM and love it. cc
web apps?
please do 🙏🏻
nah too expensive. ended up going for rx100!

oh man...felt like I was going down a rabbit hole
ha, good one.
hate when that happens when I'm editing photos
twitterverse is small yo
But it makes complete sense bc of network effect -- ppl are gonna share/tweet the app if they like it
For the past hour, I've been trying to think of reasons why this wouldn't be the case but just can't.
wow interesting hypothesis and case studies forsure
always a fine line
Sure! What's your bank account # and password?
love this.
someone becoming an angel? 😉
did you single-handedly just make a hashtag trend? http://t.co/SKvd7HWpac
sooooo jealous.
on that note, is the ability to highlight articles in the pipeline? :)
what'd y'all make!
ugh you've got to be kidding me. I literally just got the rx100.
simmer down, don't need to tag all my accounts yo 😛
you should just tap them on the shoulder (obviously not creepy at all) and ask.
*unfollows*
tbh I just add a bit of grain to my photos in LR to make it look more hipster #whatisfilm
guyssss, when are we going to shoot? 😀📷
heartwarming story
wholeheartedly agree.
neverrrrrr
only got 4 RTs and 2 Favs :(
or leave our homes. but that'd just be depressing.

You know you're growing up when you have to start scheduling hangouts into Google calendar 😓
congrats!! what's the process behind getting verified?
what is a typewriter?!?! I've actually never used one that worked and want to 😄
casey is def the definition of a #teen
American Typewriter 👀 my least favorite font
indeed indeed
would love to come back inside. was getting chilly out here!
honestly I could go on and on about the pros of Outlook
Mailbox = janky, esp. their search. Outlook has cal + files + search emails by contact + Focused vs Other autocategorization
hahahaha
and Twitter, Uber, Lyft lol
could also examine jawbone and fitbit
just never seems enough 😔
