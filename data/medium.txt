55 things learned as a 19 year old VC

Background about myself :
Analyst at Binary Capital –
Early stage consumer tech VC firm with $300m under management founded by Justin Caldbeck (former Managing Director @ Lightspeed) and Jonathan Teo (former Managing Director @ General Catalyst)

This might be useful to you if you want to learn more about the VC industry as a founder, junior VC, or aspiring VC

It’s divided into 3 sections — feel free to skip around:
Overview of what I learned about the whole industry
Suggestions for founders
Suggestions for junior VCs
Things I learned about the VC Industry:
The job is so unstructured
 I knew going in that being a VC was going to be a pretty unstructured job, but I didn’t know it was going to be *this* unstructured
 Basically, sink or swim
 🏊
VC Pipeline = Access/Network + Judgment + Winning
 Venture Capital is basically 3 things: 1) getting access to investment rounds — this includes both hearing about the companies, which involves having a diverse and strong network, & also being able to get in front of the entrepreneur if a relationship hasn’t already been built
 2) assessing potential investments and developing good judgment in picking the best companies from a sea of thousands
 3) convincing the founders to take your money
 As a VC, you have to build a reputation as someone who can add real value (some examples are helping with recruiting, PR, business development, community, branding, product/design/technical aspects) & someone who they can rant to and have a shoulder to cry on during difficult times

I learned how to ask better questions and definitely underestimated how important and hard it is to ask the right questions which will get you the answers you are looking for
 It took sitting in on a ton of startup pitches with Justin and Jon and taking notes on the questions they asked to develop this soft skill
 The key to asking good questions is admitting what you don’t know, and being able to clearly articulate what you do understand
 Next most important thing is to actually listen

To expand on that, always ask why
 Keep digging deeper until you can’t ask why anymore
 Justin unequivocally drilled this trait into me in the last year, and it’s been such a valuable mindset to adopt

Consumer tech falls under 2 categories: social or transactional (marketplaces, e-commerce, financial tech, health tech, real estate, etc)

High-level framework that I adopted from Jon for assessing consumer social products: 1) Does it have utility and actually solve a real problem? 2) Does it appeal to people’s innate narcissism? 3) Is it entertaining? 4) Is there a passionate community that’s talking about your product online without being forced or paid to do so (do a quick Twitter search)? Let’s break down a popular consumer social product at its early stages — Instagram
 Utility? Their photo filters made your photos look way better
 Narcissism? People get to show off how cool their life is and build a personal portfolio of snapshots from their oh-so-awesome life
 Entertaining? I could spend hours scrolling through my Instagram feed looking at all the beautiful photos people are sharing, making me want to travel to a certain country or eat at a specific restaurant
 Community? No question

Consumer social products typically evolve as such: Utility → Platform → Ecosystem
Personal high-level framework for assessing consumer marketplaces: 1) Positive unit economics 2) Amazing branding 3) Strong community 4) Great SEO/ASO (Search Engine Optimization / App Store Optimization)
Be nice
 Simple advice
 But somehow, it’s not expressed enough in this community
 It makes me sad that being nice is a competitive advantage as a VC in this day and age

No one knows what they’re doing
 Seriously
 No matter how much they pretend like they do ;) I’ve met a ton of successful partners who you would expect could predict the future based on their track record and are aiming to skate where the puck is going, but when I talk to them, they seem to have as much of a clue as I do…
VC is a service business, and basically sales
 You’re always selling
 You’re “selling” yourself and your firm to entrepreneurs as someone they should partner with and take money from
 You’re “selling” your portfolio companies to potential hires, users, partnerships, and investors
 You’re “selling” to LPs to get them to invest in your fund
 Always be sellin’

Be super open-minded
 You can try to be as unbiased as you want but you will inevitably still be, so try your best to remove preconceptions when looking at a company
 Especially don’t underestimate the products that look like toys initially
 For Series A rounds and onwards, data wins, after you believe in the premise/vision + team, of course

You trade in your beginner’s mindset for a more analytical assessment on ideas
 By that I mean, initially, you believe anything is possible and that so many ideas are cool
 After spending some time in the space and learning about what types of companies become successful, you stop looking at the world through a rainbow, all-is-great, point of view
 You start asking better, and more, questions
 You don’t just take anything at face value anymore
 I’m happy about this but it also means I think about an idea for weeks before I decide whether it’s worth pursuing rather than just hacking it together in a weekend and shipping it

Transparency + Honesty + Empathy + Integrity
 Work with people who possess these traits
 And obviously, hold yourself to the same standards

Pro-Tip for those looking to get into venture: When VC firms close new funds, they’re most likely going to be hiring

VC is fun if you’re naturally competitive, and it won’t be if you aren’t

People I haven’t talked to in 5 years started hitting me up
 It’s bizarre but I guess everyone’s a founder of some sort of app nowadays? 😂
This seems obvious but spend time where the people you want to meet hang out
 If you want to meet VCs → Twitter
 If you want to meet engineers or designers or learn those skills → hackathons are a good place to start
 Build a strong network in a relevant, concentrated space
 Reach out to people who have a job you think you’d be interested in doing

Regardless of what you want to do, you need to build your personal brand
 Start with an active online presence, because, you know, it’s 2017 and people need to be able to find you on the interwebs
 In fact, they shouldn’t have to find you — they should just see you, and then start seeing you everywhere
 Lots of doors opened up to me because I spent a lot of time in the last 3 years building my online brand and persona, specifically on Twitter
 In fact, for the 1st year I started using Twitter, people started referring to me as “Tiffany from Twitter
 ”
Have strong opinions, weakly held
 Have thick skin and be fearless
 Jump into Twitter conversations where you feel like you don’t belong, ask questions even if you think they’re stupid, generously give your ideas to others, share unique perspectives on topics, have conviction, and express your thoughts even if they may be wrong
 Don’t be stubborn, rude, and annoying
 But most importantly, be willing to learn from others and develop a growth mindset

Double opt-in intros
 Always

When asking for intros, make it as easy as possible for the connector
 For example, send an email to the connector that they can easily forward to the person you’d like to be introduced to

Venture capital has an incredibly long feedback loop
 You have no idea if you’re performing well or not, besides qualitative feedback from your partners, portfolio companies, and founders you pass on if they’re willing to give you feedback
 It can get disheartening when you spend hours and weeks looking through hundreds of companies and don’t end up investing in any

No one will be able to tell you how to succeed, because no one knows

The default mode is FAILURE

Early stage VC is 95% based on team, product, and market, and 5% on numbers and data

In my humble opinion, passion, hard work, empathy, hustle, and self-awareness outweighs intelligence and analytical skills

“Never let anyone regret that they spent time with you
” — Jon Teo
Be skeptical
 Don’t believe everything you hear! I don’t want to be a cynic, but this rule applies to life too, unfortunately

And try to avoid as much gossip as possible, whether you’re a VC or a founder
 The VC world in SF and NYC are especially dense and word will spread quickly

After being ingrained in the VC world for awhile, you learn a lot about human psychology, social structures, understanding power dynamics, and the art of persuasion
 How do you message someone in order to get a response or a meeting? Who’s the best person to first reach out to — managing director? associate? analyst? Who are the decision makers?
I got overwhelmed meeting so many people in the past year, probably in the thousands
 My good friend Sarah Guo described the job best when we were discussing the extremely extroverted personality that’s required to be a good VC, especially as a junior VC who is just getting started


And lastly, you’ve heard this before already, but there’s nothing more important than surrounding yourself with the best — people who not only make you smarter and more well-rounded, but also a better person

You are who you hang out with
 Choose very wisely

To founders:
The sad truth is that most VCs are super ADD and get distracted/bored quickly
 Don’t wait till the middle of your pitch to unveil whatever makes your startup better than the others
 Cut to the chase

Here are a few example questions VCs will ask to get a sense of the overall startup: On background & team — what made you want to build this company? how did the founders meet? (essentially testing for founder-market fit) On traction & ability to execute — for consumer social products: active users (DAU / WAU / MAU), retention, engagement
 For consumer marketplaces: check out Bill Gurley’s piece and Version One’s guide

Reply to junior VCs
 They have a lot more power than you think, and can help push your company through their firm’s pipeline

Reply to VCs even if they pass on you
 Also don’t be unnecessarily aggressive if this does end up happening – just prove them wrong

Keep junior folks in the loop
 This is probably more relevant for communication with smaller VC firms, rather than with big ones
 For me, on an investment team of 4, I always felt extra appreciated when founders took the time to find my email after the meeting and loop me into follow up emails and updates
 Trust me, we notice
 The little things matter

Be confident in yourself and your business — don’t let VCs push you around

Just like how a potential investor is going to do a background check on you, you should do the same with him/her and the firm
 Talk to 1–2 of each: 1) current investments 2) dead portfolio companies and maybe even 3) founders they passed on
 It’s surprising how many people don’t talk about this, but it’s quite important to know whether this VC is actually useful, will help you through thick and thin, and will follow through on promises

Check out this tweet below and think about how it relates to your company and end goal, and whether you even need VC money
 Not everyone needs to raise, and sometimes bootstrapping is the way to go


To junior VCs:
Use Twitter
 I built most of my “adult” network on Twitter
 I can’t stress enough how valuable it is to use if you work in tech – I sometimes speak at conferences and a big portion of my talk is about how “Twitter changed my life
 ” My close friend Blake Robbins is a VC in Detroit, yet still gets great deal flow because of the network he’s built on Twitter — we obviously met on there and now we talk pretty much everyday! Here are some Twitter tips from my buddy Ryan Dawidjan

But do NOT use tech VC Twitter for sourcing – that results in false positives and falling prey to investing off of hype and FOMO
 What I mean by this is, once a consumer app starts blowing up, you’ll see the VC world start tweeting about it with each other and hyping it up on Twitter
 2 things happen as a result: 1
 This creates a false positive in terms of how popular the app actually is amongst normal users because it’s just VCs talking about it in their own bubble
 2
 This also leads to FOMO because VCs start scrambling to get into the deal because they think other VCs are talking about the company and potentially investing, so they should to

This leads to my next point…develop your own conviction around companies
 Don’t just blindly agree with your colleagues, partners, or VCs who have spectacular track records without asking your own questions
 Come up with thoughts on a company before you ask a senior VC what they think
 And then compare and learn
 The senior VC may not always be right, but you can still learn a lot

Don’t be transactional
 It’s very obvious and also very easy to fall down this path because of how much you want to succeed — “great to meet you! what are 3 deals you are currently looking at?” or “hi teen! are there any apps that are blowing up in your school or amongst you and your friends?” For me, it’s always been friends first, business second
 Up to you on how you want to play though
 Be authentic
 Founders can tell when an investor is actually interested in talking to the team/founders vs purely trying to get “deal flow
 ” Don’t
do
it
 🙄
Time management tips that I wish I implemented earlier: Block off chunks of time for different projects you are working on or different parts of your job, preferably recurring
 Set off some time every morning and night to go through and clean out your inbox as well as follow up with folks with a priority on founders
 I remember a friend of mine told me he blocked off every Friday morning to focus on doing deep dives on sectors he wanted to learn more about
 It’s incredibly easy for everything to spiral out of control if you don’t manage it well, especially your inbox

Tools I use: Clearbit Connect (Gmail widget: find emails + smart contact info), Rapportive (Gmail widget: smart contact info), Streak (CRM in your inbox), Voila Norbert (find emails), Calendly (schedule calls/meetings), Google Calendar (RIP Sunrise 😢), Outlook iOS
Newsletters I read: Strictly VC, LAUNCH Ticker, Ben Thompson’s Stratechery, The Information, CB Insights, Mattermark Daily
Meeting suggestions: I prefer 15m calls for quick chats/advice, 30m video calls for initial intros and potential investments, 1h meetings if local + post-intro meeting/call
 Like I said earlier, I don’t suggest doing back to back calls, let alone meetings, to give yourself some time to recap the prior conversation
 In addition, when arranging calls, make sure to suggest times in the timezone of the recipient, not just your own
 It’s just a nice thing to do

Email management: Here’s the setup I used
 Use Streak
 Set up a filter for all your newsletters

Email management as an early adopter: Make a new email for all the beta products or new apps you try out and waitlists you sign up for
 Or even simpler, set up a Gmail filter and append a plus sign or period and a word to the end of your email address (e
 g
 using hi+beta@tiffanyzhong
 com for beta apps)
Treat founders with an insane amount of respect
 Be very careful about this newfound power dynamic and don’t let it change you — stay true to your values and humility
 Reply to emails within a few days (I was unfortunately terrible at email management and wish I was better)
 Don’t reschedule founders 5x
 Don’t cancel at the last minute
 Try not to be late to meetings (do not do back to back meetings — you will be late and you will hate yourself
 )
 Don’t be rude or unnecessarily abrasive during meetings
 Don’t act entitled
 You’re no better than the founder
 As a VC, you’re here to support, advise, and give a shoulder for founders to cry on (metaphorically, but maybe literally too)
 You’re not here to steal the spotlight from the founders
 And you’re definitely not here to run the company

At the same time, be straightforward and honest, but with a humble tone
 Give feedback with anecdotal evidence and explain why you are *actually* passing on the company, rather than giving a generic pass response
 Read Ben Horowitz’s post repeatedly until you finally have the guts to be real with founders

My favorite question to ask VCs and founders alike is “What are your biggest concerns?” A lot of VCs will hype up a potential investment or portfolio company, so you want to dig deeper and figure out what the biggest investment risks are
 As for founders, I think it’ll bring out self-awareness and thoughtfulness if you can answer that question well

Some founders are very good at answering investors’ typical questions, but it doesn’t mean that they’re smart or that their company is doing well
 Be able to identify the differences between whether someone is actually smart or just great at answering “correctly
 ”
Last thing…being a VC is not as glamorous as you think
 It’s not all private jets and parties on yachts (neither of which I have been on)

 If you’re a talented engineer or designer looking for a fun side project, shoot me an email! 🔑

It means replying to iMessages and Snapchats within an hour

It means taking 10 photos of every meal you have and uploading the best one out of the 10 to Instagram and/or Facebook

It means taking a ton of selfies on Snapchat when you are with friends or bored at home

It means having a “finsta” (fake Instagram) aka 2 Instagram accounts — 1 public account for pretty photos + 1 private account for random, personal photos where you only allow close friends to follow it

It means running out of iPhone battery before school is over and having to charge it at school and/or bringing a portable charger everywhere

It means binge watching on Netflix with friends rather than going to parties

It means applying metallic flash tattoos (temporary, don’t worry) to yourself if you’re a girl
